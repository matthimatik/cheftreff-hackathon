                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    In November 2024, <strong>61%</strong> of surveyed households in Yemen struggled to obtain adequate food. This rate is 1% lower than the previous month but 31% higher than the previous year.

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
                    <li>Inadequate food consumption was reported by <strong>64%</strong> in southern Yemen (IRG areas) and <strong>59%</strong> in northern Yemen (SBA areas).</li>
                    <li>Severe food deprivation (poor food consumption) remained alarmingly high: <strong>36%</strong> in IRG areas and <strong>34%</strong> in SBA areas.</li>
                    <li>SBA areas saw a 4% month-on-month drop in poor food consumption and a 7% drop compared to August 2024 (before recent food distributions).</li>
                    <li>Most governorates exceeded the "very high" threshold (â‰¥20%) for poor food consumption, with peaks in Ad Dali', Lahj, Shabwah, Raymah, and Al Jawf.</li>

                    <li><strong>Economic Challenges:</strong> Widespread economic difficulties across the country.</li>
                    <li><strong>Funding Shortages:</strong> Insufficient funding for humanitarian aid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pause in Food Assistance:</strong> Suspension of aid in most SBA districts previously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Income Generation:</strong> Reported by 71% in the north (highest in 5 years) and 59% in the south.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> A major challenge, especially in Sa'dah, Ma'rib, Al Jawf, Shabwah, and Ibb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Issues:</strong> Obstacles related to health, exacerbated by the ongoing cholera outbreak (high caseloads in Al Hodeidah, Hajjah, Amran, Dhamar).</li>

                    <li><strong>Severe Food-Based Coping:</strong> Used by 55% of households in the north and 48% in the south.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Livelihood-Based Coping:</strong> Adopted by 27% in the north and 26% in the south (significant year-on-year increases).</li>
                    <li><strong>Begging:</strong> Indicated by 9% in the north compared to 5% in the south.</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Minimum Food Basket (MFB) Cost</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>IRG Areas:</strong> MFB cost reached new record highs monthly in 2024. In Nov 2024, it was <strong>22% higher</strong> year-on-year due to currency depreciation, rising fuel prices, and global food prices. Ma'rib and Ad Dali' saw the highest annual rise.</li>
                    <li><strong>SBA Areas:</strong> MFB cost saw a <strong>9% decline</strong> year-on-year due to strict price controls.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Currency Exchange Rate (End Nov 2024)</h3>
                 <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>IRG Areas:</strong> Yemeni Riyal (YER) hit an all-time low of <strong>YER 2,054/USD</strong>, losing 26% value year-on-year and 72% over five years. Driven by low foreign reserves, reduced oil exports, and lower remittances.</li>
                    <li><strong>SBA Areas:</strong> Riyal remained relatively stable at <strong>YER 533/USD</strong> (1% depreciation year-on-year) due to strict controls, but facing economic slowdown and liquidity concerns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Fuel Imports & Prices</h3>
                 <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Imports (Jan-Nov 2024):</strong> Similar levels via Red Sea ports compared to 2023 (-1%), but a 9% decline via southern ports (Aden/Mukalla).</li>
                    <li><strong>Concerns:</strong> Fuel stock levels in SBA areas due to damaged storage infrastructure at Al Hodeidah/Ras Issa ports. No fuel imports via Al Hodeidah since late July (except limited JET A1).</li>
                    <li><strong>Prices (IRG Areas):</strong> Record high petrol prices (+9% year-on-year) and increased diesel prices (+7% year-on-year), despite lower global oil prices, driven by currency depreciation and import issues.</li>
                     <li><strong>Prices (SBA Areas):</strong> WFP unable to collect price data since June 2024.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Volume (Jan-Nov 2024):</strong> Increased by 14% through both Red Sea and southern ports compared to 2023.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability vs Access:</strong> Essential food items were available, but access remained challenging due to declining household purchasing power.</li>

                    <li>Vegetable Oil Price Index saw a significant increase (+7% month-on-month, +32% year-on-year), reaching the highest level since July 2022.</li>

                    <li><strong>IRG Areas:</strong> Due to funding shortages, WFP reduced targeted beneficiaries from 3.6 million to <strong>2.8 million</strong> starting from the 4th food assistance cycle (early Dec 2024).</li>
                    <li><strong>SBA Areas:</strong> The new Targeted Emergency Food Assistance (TEFA) programme started in Nov 2024, assisting <strong>1.4 million people</strong> with reduced rations.</li>
                    <li><strong>TEFA Impact:</strong> Post-distribution monitoring showed improvement; the share of beneficiaries with poor food consumption dropped from 52% (Aug) to <strong>37%</strong> (Nov), similar to levels before the assistance pause. WFP plans to expand TEFA.</li>
