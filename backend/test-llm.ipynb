       "*   Food security remained critical in Syria in early December 2024, exacerbated by a recent governance shift impacting market stability and humanitarian access. Prior to the shift on November 27th, 9.1 million people were already food insecure, with 1.3 million severely food insecure and 5.4 million at risk.\n",
       "*   The cost of living is anticipated to have soared in December, primarily driven by a significant depreciation of the Syrian Pound (SYP) on the parallel market following the governance change. While a full Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) analysis for December is not yet available, early market monitoring up to December 8th in Aleppo indicated sharp price increases for essential food items, including a 150% rise for apples, 88% for bananas, 900% for bakery bread (though from a very low base), 67% for cheese, 18% for eggs, and 119% for chicken meat compared to November 27th.\n",
       "*   The governance shift's short-term effects, including limited labor opportunities and reduced cash liquidity, have likely pushed more vulnerable families towards irreversible coping mechanisms. Media reports indicate increased burglaries and looting in major townships.\n",
       "*   Market stability is significantly impacted by the ongoing chaos in major cities and uncertain supply routes. Many stores face depleted stocks or closure due to panic buying and disruptions.\n",
       "*   Basic needs, including bread, fuel, and electricity, face increasing uncertainty. Public and private bakeries, reliant on subsidies, are expected to face disruptions due to limited access to raw materials and fuel.\n",
       "*   The average national price of diesel used in transport saw a sharp increase in December, reaching SYP 15,763 per liter by December 15th, a 34% rise from November 15th. Oil prices also increased significantly, reaching SYP 34,952 per liter by December 15th, a 32% rise from November 15th.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Key Narrative**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Food Availability:**\n",
       "    *   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The closure of border crossings with Lebanon since late September and the recent governance shift have severely impacted supply chains. Shifting control dynamics and the need for new agreements among parties will influence the short to medium-term market dynamics. Cross-border trade is now heavily reliant on internal policy, currency stability, and the international community's perception and acceptance of the transitional leadership.\n",
       "    *   **Impact on Bread Production:** Bread production, a staple for vulnerable populations, faces significant disruptions. Public and private bakeries are dependent on government-subsidized fuel and wheat flour, and limited access to these resources is expected to cause major issues with availability and production.\n",
       "    *   **Scarcity of Fresh Produce:** Fresh vegetables and fruits are becoming increasingly scarce due to a combination of seasonal declines and disrupted trade routes.\n",
       "    *   **Conflict-Driven Market Constraints:** Imposed curfews, safety concerns (including social unrest, looting, and territorial disputes), and potential infrastructure damage will likely reduce access to essential goods and services through outlets like WFP retailers, restaurants, and food vendors. These factors risk driving up the cost of living and deepening the humanitarian crisis.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Currency Impact:**\n",
       "    *   The Syrian pound has experienced a dramatic depreciation in early December following the governance shift, with the parallel market exchange rate reaching alarming levels in some areas (up to 45,000 SYP per USD by Dec 7th from around 15,000 SYP in October). This sharp decline is fueling hyperinflation and depleting supply levels, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. Heightened demand, potential introduction of multiple currencies, and emergency mass cash conversions driven by fears of total devaluation further contribute to the volatile situation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Humanitarian Concerns:**\n",
       "    *   **WFP Response Challenges:** A significant portion of WFP's assistance relies on Cash-Based Transfers (CBT), which require functional banking systems, sufficient liquidity, and consistent supplies at retailers. The ongoing instability poses a significant risk of delaying or halting assistance delivery. In December, supporting severely food insecure households, particularly in North West Syria, is challenged by access issues, with initial estimates suggesting a large percentage may not be able to access aid. Looting of WFP warehouses has caused major setbacks, impacting the ability to provide timely assistance. Partners' assets and infrastructure have also been affected, hindering registration and distribution efforts.\n",
       "    *   **Impact of Shifting Territorial Controls:** Changes in territorial control necessitate extensive negotiations to adapt programmatic and logistical arrangements. This includes modifying assistance modalities, adjusting food dispatches, and securing approvals for commodity movement to ensure aid reaches the most vulnerable populations amidst evolving control dynamics.\n",
       "    *   **Challenges to accessing basic needs:** Access to essential needs like bread, fuel, and electricity is increasingly uncertain. The traditional government bread subsidy, a crucial safety net, faces questions about its sustainability. Disruptions in electricity supply and fuel for generators, resulting in prolonged outages, further complicate the situation. Faltering systems for sharing resources under a social protection framework may lead to further instability in accessing basic needs.\n",
       "    *   **Syrian refugees returning to Syria:** Millions of Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries may be influenced by developments in Syria when considering return. However, significant challenges remain due to operational hurdles and funding shortages faced by WFP and other humanitarian organizations, hindering their capacity to support both returnees and those already in Syria.\n",
       "    *   **Limited monitoring:** WFP's ability to conduct physical market monitoring is expected to be increasingly constrained until a semblance of order and safety is restored. This limitation will hinder timely assessments of market dynamics, price fluctuations, and the availability of essential goods, impacting informed decision-making and programme adjustments.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Forecast:**\n",
       "    *   **Short-Term:** Prices for essential goods are expected to skyrocket, and the SYP is likely to depreciate further as the situation remains tense. WFP contracted retailers and other trading outlets will need time to adapt to the rapidly changing environment, including security issues, exchange rate volatility, supply route disruptions, and potential regulatory changes.\n",
       "    *   **Medium-Term:** Limited agricultural production and disrupted supply chains may lead to prolonged price volatility and reduced market functionality, impacting the availability and affordability of goods.\n",
       "    *   **Long-term:** The success of the incoming leadership in implementing effective policies and establishing governance will be crucial for revitalizing cross-border trade, lifting sanctions, and achieving normalization and international acceptance. The long-term impact on markets and food security hinges on these factors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Action Points | VAM**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Market Monitoring:** Maintain close monitoring of price changes and supply disruptions, focusing on staple food and fuel.\n",
       "*   **Forecast Updates:** Provide timely updates on supply route changes and currency fluctuations, as well as other factors driving Syria's markets.\n",
       "*   **Tailored Assessments:** Conduct rapid needs and national food security assessments to accurately portray the situation and effects of recent intertwined crises.\n",
