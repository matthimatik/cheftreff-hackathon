       "\n",
       "*   The cost of living, as measured by the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB), saw a significant increase in December 2024 due to an inflationary shock caused by the liberalization of fuel prices and increased subsidized bread costs [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125). The monthly inflation rate reached 15.1 percent nationwide [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "*   Governorates previously under the former government's control experienced the highest monthly inflation, with Hama and Quneitra recording 24.4 percent, followed by Tartous (23.5 percent), As-Sweida (22.7 percent), and Homs (22.4 percent) [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125). Conversely, Idleb saw a 1 percent decrease, Ar-Raqqa a 0.6 percent decline, and Al-Hasakeh a 0.3 percent decrease [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "*   The Transportation group contributed significantly to the monthly inflation, with a 45 percent rise, while the Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and other fuel groups increased by 41.7 percent [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125). These rises directly impacted transportation costs and are expected to affect agricultural and industrial production costs [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "*   Despite the significant price increases, the price index for the Food and Non-alcoholic Beverages group contributed to reducing the overall inflation rate by 8 percent in December [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "*   The parallel market exchange rate saw extreme fluctuations in December in response to political and conflict-related developments [REACH](https://reliefweb.int/node/4123317), ranging from SYP 15,000 to SYP 25,000 per USD [IBC](https://reliefweb.int/node/4121616), before settling between SYP 15,000 and SYP 16,000 by mid-December [NES NGO Forum](https://reliefweb.int/node/4119276). The rapid fluctuations impacted businesses' ability to operate [REACH](https://reliefweb.int/node/4123317).\n",
       "*   The cost of water trucking in Northwest Syria increased by 36% between October and December [REACH](https://reliefweb.int/node/4123327). Fuel availability and price surges in Northeast Syria further exacerbated the cost of essential services like water trucking [REACH](https://reliefweb.int/node/4123317).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB)\n",
       "\n",
       "In December 2024, Syria experienced a significant inflationary shock, with the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising by 15.1 percent month-on-month, leading to a 49.7 percent annual inflation rate [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125). This surge was primarily driven by decisions to liberalize the prices of diesel, gasoline, and domestic gas, and to increase the price of subsidized bread [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "\n",
       "Governorates formerly under the previous government's control bore the brunt of this inflation, with Hama and Quneitra experiencing the highest monthly rates at 24.4 percent, followed by Tartous (23.5 percent), As-Sweida (22.7 percent), and Homs (22.4 percent) [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125). In contrast, Idleb saw a 1 percent decrease in CPI, Ar-Raqqa a 0.6 percent decline, and Al-Hasakeh a 0.3 percent decrease [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "\n",
       "The MEB abject poverty line (food deprivation) reached SYP 3.08 million per month, the lower poverty line SYP 4.84 million, and the upper poverty line SYP 6.68 million [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125). Real wages for government employees decreased by 14.6 percent and for private/civil sectors by 12 percent compared to November [SCPR](https://reliefweb.int/node/4142125).\n",
       "\n",
       "Data regarding the average cost of the MEB and its components for December 2024 across all governorates was not available at the time of this report. Information regarding regional MEB costs was also unavailable for December 2024.\n",
       "\n",
       "The annual rise in food costs within the MEB in October 2024 was notably driven by significant increases in the prices of potatoes (up 65 percent), parsley (64 percent), and bakery bread (60 percent) [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). Over the past year (Oct 2023-Oct 2024), the MEB food component rose by 21 percent [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).\n",

Vegetable oils saw the largest increase (7.3 percent), while cereal prices also rose (0.8 percent), driven by global wheat and maize markets [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). Rice prices, however, fell by 5.6 percent [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).\n",

       "Regional food inflation in October 2024 saw Turkey's rate reach 48.57 percent (up 4.85 percent from September) [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). Lebanon's food inflation was 22.77 percent (up 3.09 percent) [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). Russia saw a slight decrease to 9 percent (down from 9.2 percent) [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).

       "*   **Rice**: The average price remained unchanged at SYP 15,991 per kg compared to September [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). It was 4 percent lower than Oct 2023 [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). South had the highest price (SYP 16,703/kg) [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).\n",
       "*   **Chicken**: The national average price decreased by 4 percent month-on-month to SYP 36,581 per kg [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). Coastal areas had the highest price (SYP 41,469/kg) [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).\n",
       "*   **Eggs**: The price of a tray of 30 eggs remained stable at SYP 54,011 in October [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).\n",

       "\n",
       "By the end of October 2024, the parallel market exchange rate averaged SYP 14,922 per US dollar [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file). The official exchange rate remained stable at SYP 12,562 since Dec 2023 [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).\n",
       "\n",

Localized fluctuations reportedly impacted businesses' ability to operate [REACH](https://reliefweb.int/node/4123317). The rapid fluctuations had a profound impact on the market [NES NGO Forum](https://reliefweb.int/node/4119276). By January 2025, the informal regional median SYP/USD exchange rate recorded a 7% increase compared to October 2024 [REACH](https://reliefweb.int/node/4123317).

The price of a 25-liter butane gas cylinder on the parallel market reached SYP 307,806 in October, up 13 percent [CSV (INTERNAL)](csv-file).
