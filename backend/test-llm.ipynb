       "*   Food security remained critical in Syria in early December 2024, exacerbated by a recent governance shift impacting market stability and humanitarian access. Prior to the shift on November 27th, 9.1 million people were already food insecure, with 1.3 million severely food insecure and 5.4 million at risk.\n",
       "*   The cost of living is anticipated to have soared in December, primarily driven by a significant depreciation of the Syrian Pound (SYP) on the parallel market following the governance change. While a full Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) analysis for December is not yet available, early market monitoring up to December 8th in Aleppo indicated sharp price increases for essential food items, including a 150% rise for apples, 88% for bananas, 900% for bakery bread (though from a very low base), 67% for cheese, 18% for eggs, and 119% for chicken meat compared to November 27th.\n",
       "*   The governance shift's short-term effects, including limited labor opportunities and reduced cash liquidity, have likely pushed more vulnerable families towards irreversible coping mechanisms. Media reports indicate increased burglaries and looting in major townships.\n",
       "*   Market stability is significantly impacted by the ongoing chaos in major cities and uncertain supply routes. Many stores face depleted stocks or closure due to panic buying and disruptions.\n",
       "*   Basic needs, including bread, fuel, and electricity, face increasing uncertainty. Public and private bakeries, reliant on subsidies, are expected to face disruptions due to limited access to raw materials and fuel.\n",
       "*   The average national price of diesel used in transport saw a sharp increase in December, reaching SYP 15,763 per liter by December 15th, a 34% rise from November 15th.

       "\n",
       "**Key Narrative**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Food Availability:**\n",
       "    *   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The closure of border crossings with Lebanon since late September and the recent governance shift have severely impacted supply chains. Shifting control dynamics and the need for new agreements among parties will influence the short to medium-term market dynamics. Cross-border trade is now heavily reliant on internal policy, currency stability, and the international community's perception and acceptance of the transitional leadership.\n",
       "    *   **Impact on Bread Production:** Bread production, a staple for vulnerable populations, faces significant disruptions. Public and private bakeries are dependent on government-subsidized fuel and wheat flour, and limited access to these resources is expected to cause major issues with availability and production.\n",
       "    *   **Scarcity of Fresh Produce:** Fresh vegetables and fruits are becoming increasingly scarce due to a combination of seasonal declines and disrupted trade routes.\n",
       "    *   **Conflict-Driven Market Constraints:** Imposed curfews, safety concerns (including social unrest, looting, and territorial disputes), and potential infrastructure damage will likely reduce access to essential goods and services through outlets like WFP retailers, restaurants, and food vendors. These factors risk driving up the cost of living and deepening the humanitarian crisis.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Currency Impact:**\n",
       "    *   The Syrian pound has experienced a dramatic depreciation in early December following the governance shift, with the parallel market exchange rate reaching alarming levels in some areas (up to 45,000 SYP per USD by Dec 7th from around 15,000 SYP in October). This sharp decline is fueling hyperinflation and depleting supply levels, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. Heightened demand, potential introduction of multiple currencies, and emergency mass cash conversions driven by fears of total devaluation further contribute to the volatile situation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Humanitarian Concerns:**\n",
       "    *   **WFP Response Challenges:** A significant portion of WFP's assistance relies on Cash-Based Transfers (CBT), which require functional banking systems, sufficient liquidity, and consistent supplies at retailers. The ongoing instability poses a significant risk of delaying or halting assistance delivery. In December, supporting severely food insecure households, particularly in North West Syria, is challenged by access issues, with initial estimates suggesting a large percentage may not be able to access aid. Looting of WFP warehouses has caused major setbacks, impacting the ability to provide timely assistance. Partners' assets and infrastructure have also been affected, hindering registration and distribution efforts.\n",
       "    *   **Impact of Shifting Territorial Controls:** Changes in territorial control necessitate extensive negotiations to adapt programmatic and logistical arrangements. This includes modifying assistance modalities, adjusting food dispatches, and securing approvals for commodity movement to ensure aid reaches the most vulnerable populations amidst evolving control dynamics.\n",
       "    *   **Challenges to accessing basic needs:** Access to essential needs like bread, fuel, and electricity is increasingly uncertain. The traditional government bread subsidy, a crucial safety net, faces questions about its sustainability. Disruptions in electricity supply and fuel for generators, resulting in prolonged outages, further complicate the situation. Faltering systems for sharing resources under a social protection framework may lead to further instability in accessing basic needs.\n",
       "    *   **Syrian refugees returning to Syria:** Millions of Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries may be influenced by developments in Syria when considering return. However, significant challenges remain due to operational hurdles and funding shortages faced by WFP and other humanitarian organizations, hindering their capacity to support both returnees and those already in Syria.\n",
       "    *   **Limited monitoring:** WFP's ability to conduct physical market monitoring is expected to be increasingly constrained until a semblance of order and safety is restored. This limitation will hinder timely assessments of market dynamics, price fluctuations, and the availability of essential goods, impacting informed decision-making and programme adjustments.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Forecast:**\n",
       "    *   **Short-Term:** Prices for essential goods are expected to skyrocket, and the SYP is likely to depreciate further as the situation remains tense. WFP contracted retailers and other trading outlets will need time to adapt to the rapidly changing environment, including security issues, exchange rate volatility, supply route disruptions, and potential regulatory changes.\n",
       "    *   **Medium-Term:** Limited agricultural production and disrupted supply chains may lead to prolonged price volatility and reduced market functionality, impacting the availability and affordability of goods.\n",
       "    *   **Long-term:** The success of the incoming leadership in implementing effective policies and establishing governance will be crucial for revitalizing cross-border trade, lifting sanctions, and achieving normalization and international acceptance. The long-term impact on markets and food security hinges on these factors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Action Points | VAM**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Market Monitoring:** Maintain close monitoring of price changes and supply disruptions, focusing on staple food and fuel.\n",
       "*   **Forecast Updates:** Provide timely updates on supply route changes and currency fluctuations, as well as other factors driving Syria's markets.\n",
       "*   **Tailored Assessments:** Conduct rapid needs and national food security assessments to accurately portray the situation and effects of recent intertwined crises.\n",

This marked the end of a decade of civil war, altering the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. While this has sparked hope for millions of Syrians, it has exposed significant gaps in health and humanitarian needs.\\n\\nBefore the fall of Assad’s regime, over 16 million people needed urgent humanitarian assistance in Syria. Additionally, Syria had been the epicenter of the world’s largest displacement crisis over the past decade. Nearly 13 million Syrians had been displaced, including 7 million internally displaced people (IDPs) and 6 million living as refugees abroad. Now, many Syrian refugees and IDPs are opting to return home, while others are fleeing the country due to fears of what may come with a change in leadership.\\n\\nNow, impacted areas across Syria – including Aleppo, Hama, Homs, and Damascus – are facing critical gaps in healthcare, nutrition, mental healthcare, and water, hygiene, and sanitation (WASH).

Northeast Syria (NES) has faced continued socio-economic instability and a multitude of compounding crises related to conflict and climate disasters, which has disproportionately affected women and girls of diverse identities (i.e. female-headed households, widows, older women, adolescents, and those living with disability). Prior to the transition, over 2.6 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in NES, and approximately 165,000 individuals lived in 253 IDP sites, of whom 57% were under the age of 18 and 56% were female. Since November 27th, an estimated 100,000 people (including 23,000 people fleeing violence in Lebanon) have arrived in Ar-Raqqa and Al-Hasakah governorates seeking refuge from escalating hostilities across the region, with only 8% of assessed households knowing their intended destination.\\n\\nAccess to services remains challenging due to various factors such as political unrest, roadblocks by armed groups, supply chain coordination difficulties, limited availability of frontline workers, heightened security threats and curfews, particularly in Al-Hasakah and Ar-Raqqa governorates. This civil unrest and population shifts will strain already limited humanitarian services and resources, putting vulnerable populations such as children, people with disabilities, older people, and pregnant and lactating women at greater risk. Emergency collective centers in Tabqa and Raqqa have already reached full capacity, and it is anticipated that more schools in Raqqa, Hasakah, Tabqa, Kobani, and Qamishli will be repurposed as shelters, further interrupting education across the region. Furthermore, increased hostilities and political uncertainty may impact women’s participation in political and leadership spaces.\\n\\nThis analysis highlights pre-existing and emerging vulnerabilities and risks within the Ar-Raqqa, Deir Ez Zor, and Al-Hasakah governorates with a focus on gender and age data to inform humanitarian programming in the early stages of the crisis. The Rapid Gender Analysis (RGA) methodology is designed to be built progressively and adapted to the shorter time frames, rapidly changing contexts and insecure environments that often characterize humanitarian interventions. Thus, as more information becomes available and the security situation allows, further data will be incorporated into this analysis.', original_date='2024-12-23T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Il faut préserver les preuves des atrocités de masse', body='Les autorités de transition syriennes doivent de toute urgence prendre des mesures pour protéger et préserver les preuves des atrocités perpétrées sous le gouvernement de l’ancien président Bachar el Assad, notamment les documents importants du gouvernement et des services de renseignement, ainsi que les sites où des atrocités ont été commises et où se trouvent des fosses communes, ont déclaré l’Association des détenus et disparus de la prison de Saidnaya (ADMSP), Amnesty International et Human Right Watch lundi 23 décembre 2024.\\n\\nLes autorités de transition doivent sans délai coopérer avec les organes concernés des Nations unies, la société civile syrienne et les équipes médicolégales internationales et coordonner le travail de ces différents acteurs, afin de recueillir, de préserver et de protéger ces preuves. Les traces des crimes commis seront indispensables pour déterminer ce qu’il est advenu des dizaines de milliers de Syriens et de Syriennes qui ont été soumis à une disparition forcée par les tristement célèbres services de sécurité et de renseignement de l’ancien gouvernement, ainsi que pour enquêter sur les auteurs de crimes de droit international, notamment de crimes de guerre et de crimes contre l’humanité, et pour engager des poursuites à leur encontre.\\n\\n« Chaque minute supplémentaire sans agir augmente le risque qu’une famille ne sache jamais ce qui est arrivé à son proche, et qu’un membre des autorités responsable de crimes horribles ne soit jamais traduit en justice », a déclaré Shadi Haroun, directeur de programme de l’ADMSP.\\n\\nDes chargé·e·s de recherche et d’enquête des trois organisations ont mené une mission à Damas du 10 au 20 décembre 2024 ; ils se sont notamment rendus dans 10 centres de détention, sur sept sites de fosses communes et au tribunal militaire.\\n\\n« Après des décennies d’oppression violente, d’injustice et d’impunité, les Syrien·ne·s entrevoient une lueur d’espoir d’obtenir justice, a déclaré Aya Mjazoub, directrice régionale d’Amnesty International pour le Moyen-Orient et l’Afrique du Nord. Pour les autorités syriennes de transition, c’est le moment où jamais d’agir avec résolution pour garantir la préservation des preuves, qui est un élément fondamental de l’obligation de rendre des comptes et de la réconciliation. »\\n\\nDans tous les lieux de détention visités, les chercheurs et chercheuses ont constaté que les documents officiels étaient souvent laissés sans protection, et qu’une grande partie d’entre eux avaient été pillés ou détruits. Des personnes vivant à proximité de certains de ces centres de détention, d’anciens détenu·e·s et des membres d’Hayat Tahrir al Cham se trouvant sur place ont déclaré que, dans certains cas, le personnel des services de sécurité et de renseignement avait brûlé des informations essentielles avant de fuir lors de la chute du gouvernement de Bachar el Assad.\\n\\nSelon leurs témoignages, il est aussi arrivé que des membres des groupes armés qui ont pris le contrôle de ces centres et des détenu·e·s tout juste libérés aient incendié et pillé des documents. Les chercheurs et chercheuses ont également vu des citoyen·ne·s ordinaires, tels que des familles de détenu·e·s disparus et des journalistes, s’emparer de certains documents.\\n\\nOr, ces documents pourraient contenir des [informations cruciales](https://syriaaccountability.org/walls-have-ears/) sur la structure de l’appareil de sécurité et de renseignement de l’État syrien, sur l’identité des responsables de crimes graves, et sur les personnes détenues dans ces centres.\\n\\nL’ADMSP, Amnesty International et Human Rights Watch ont fait part de leurs préoccupations à ce sujet lors d’une rencontre avec des membres du [département des affaires politiques](https://www.facebook.com/syriadpa/?locale=ar_AR) du Gouvernement de salut syrien affilié à Hayat Tahrir al Cham. Lors de cette rencontre, qui a eu lieu à Damas le 16 décembre, les responsables se sont engagés à renforcer la sécurité autour des principaux sites.\\n\\nAprès avoir protégé de toute urgence ces lieux et veillé à ce qu’il ne soit pas porté atteinte à l’intégrité des preuves restantes, les autorités de transition doivent se coordonner avec les organes internationaux d’établissement des faits et de recueil des preuves créés par les Nations unies, et leur donner immédiatement un accès illimité au territoire syrien. Elles doivent notamment travailler avec le Mécanisme international, impartial et indépendant chargé de faciliter les enquêtes sur les violations les plus graves du droit international commises en République arabe syrienne (IIIM), l’Institution indépendante chargée de la question des personnes disparues en République arabe syrienne (IIMP) et la Commission d’enquête internationale indépendante sur la République arabe syrienne (CoI), ainsi qu’avec les organisations de la société civile qui ont de l’expérience dans l’analyse de ce type de preuves.\\n\\nLe Mécanisme international d’enquête doit agir rapidement pour recueillir des preuves, notamment en concluant avec les autorités de transition un accord officiel lui permettant de travailler légalement et en toute transparence en Syrie. Il doit en priorité s’attacher à préserver, recenser et protéger les sites où se trouvent des fosses communes, les archives et les autres éléments de preuve essentiels. De même, l’Institution chargée des personnes disparues pourrait jouer un rôle de coordination afin d’unifier les efforts dispersés des groupes de la société civile syriens et internationaux en vue de recueillir des preuves susceptibles d’apporter des réponses sur le sort des personnes disparues et sur l’endroit où elles se trouvent.\\n\\nEn dirigeant un processus collaboratif et systématique de préservation des preuves, ces organes peuvent garantir la protection d’informations cruciales, ouvrant ainsi la voie à l’obligation de rendre des comptes et à la justice. Les gouvernements doivent soutenir les initiatives destinées à protéger et à sauvegarder les preuves, notamment en fournissant les ressources et les financements nécessaires.\\n\\nPendant leur rencontre avec les autorités de transition, les organisations ont aussi souligné l’importance de protéger les sites où se trouvent des fosses communes à travers le pays. Les chercheurs·euses se sont rendus sur les lieux de quatre fosses communes dans la banlieue de Damas et ont transmis les coordonnées de ces sites aux autorités concernées. Sur ces quatre sites, ils ont observé des habitant·e·s et des familles de personnes disparues essayer de déterrer certains des restes humains qui s’y trouvaient. Ils ont vu des habitant·e·s sortir d’une de ces fosses communes une jambe sur laquelle il y avait encore de la chair, ce qui indique qu’elle avait été enterrée récemment.\\n\\nEn 2017, un rapport d’Amnesty International [sur les pendaisons et la politique d’extermination à grande échelle dans la prison de Saidnaya](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/5415/2017/en/) avait conclu que les corps des détenu·e·s exécutés ou décédés des suites de la torture ou des conditions de détention inhumaines dans cette prison étaient enterrés dans des fosses communes, dont une faisait partie des sites sur lesquels les chercheurs·euses se sont rendus en décembre 2024. Sous l’ancien gouvernement, les autorités rendaient rarement les dépouilles des victimes à leur famille et, lorsqu’une personne détenue mourrait, elles n’en informaient généralement pas ses proches.\\n\\nTout au long du conflit, le gouvernement du président déchu Bachar el Assad a eu recours aux exécutions extrajudiciaires ainsi qu’à d’autres tactiques illégales, telles que les arrestations arbitraires, les attaques menées délibérément ou sans discernement contre des civil·e·s, et le fait d’affamer la population civile, afin de déplacer de force les habitant·e·s des zones contrôlées par l’opposition.\\n\\nLes exécutions extrajudiciaires et les exécutions sommaires sont de graves violations du droit international relatif aux droits humains et peuvent constituer des crimes contre l’humanité lorsqu’elles sont commises dans le cadre d’une attaque systématique ou généralisée contre la population civile, en application ou dans la poursuite de la politique d’un État ou d’une organisation ayant pour but une telle attaque. Human Rights Watch et Amnesty International ont [recueilli des informations](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2012/07/03/syrie-revelations-sur-des-centres-de-torture) permettant de conclure que le recours systématique à la [torture](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/5415/2017/en/) sous le précédent gouvernement était constitutif d’un crime contre l’humanité.\\n\\nLes autorités syriennes de transition doivent s’engager clairement et publiquement à protéger, collecter et sauvegarder les preuves, notamment les sites des fosses communes et les registres et archives du gouvernement, car celles-ci seront cruciales pour apporter aux familles des plus de 100 000 personnes disparues en Syrie des réponses sur ce qu’il est advenu de leurs proches. Elles seront aussi indispensables pour les processus d’obligation de rendre des comptes et les procédures judiciaires à venir. Les mesures conservatoires contraignantes prononcées par la Cour internationale de justice dans l’affaire de l’usage de la torture par la Syrie obligent l’État à préserver les preuves de ces atrocités.\\n\\nLes autorités syriennes de transition doivent aussi coopérer avec le Comité international de la Croix-Rouge et les organisations spécialisées de la société civile syrienne susceptibles d’apporter une expertise essentielle et une aide pour sauvegarder ces éléments de preuve, afin de contribuer à clarifier ce qui est arrivé aux personnes disparues et ainsi permettre aux familles, laissées dans une atroce incertitude pendant des années, voire des décennies, d’obtenir des réponses. Des campagnes de sensibilisation du grand public peuvent expliquer l’importance de la préservation des preuves, les mesures qui sont prises, et la manière dont les populations peuvent participer à ce processus sans l’entraver par inadvertance.\\n\\n« Les familles des dizaines de milliers de personnes disparues en Syrie méritent qu’il soit mis fin à leur tourment, a déclaré Hiba Zayadin, chercheuse senior auprès de la division Moyen-Orient et Afrique du Nord à Human Rights Watch. Beaucoup des réponses sur ce qui est arrivé à leurs proches risquent de se trouver dans des bureaux saccagés, des documents pillés ou des fosses communes altérées. Il est crucial que les Syriens et les Syriennes entendent directement de la bouche des dirigeants de transition leur attachement et leur engagement à découvrir la vérité et à apporter des réponses aux familles de disparu·e·s. »\\n\\nPour garantir l’obligation de rendre des comptes et instaurer la confiance dans leur gouvernance, les autorités de transition doivent également mettre un terme aux homicides de représailles, en faisant clairement savoir que ces crimes ne sauraient être tolérés. Elles doivent par ailleurs répondre aux préoccupations concernant la détention arbitraire dans les zones qui se trouvent sous leur contrôle. Pour cela, elles doivent notamment permettre à des observateurs ou observatrices indépendants de se rendre dans les centres de détention contrôlés par Hayat Tahrir al Cham, et veiller à ce que tous les détenu·e·s soient placés sous supervision judiciaire. La transparence sur la manière dont les prisonniers et prisonnières sont traités et détenus est indispensable pour prouver qu’il y a une véritable rupture avec les anciennes pratiques de répression de toutes les parties au conflit en Syrie, et pour faire savoir à la population syrienne que le cycle de détention arbitraire et de violence ne se reproduira pas.', original_date='2024-12-23T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Millones de personas en el noroeste de Siria están desplazadas a medida que se acerca el invierno**\\n\\nEn el noroeste de Siria hay 5,1 millones de personas, incluiyendo 3,4 millones de población internamente desplazada, en su mayoría mujeres, niñas y niños. Después de 12 años de guerra civil, las condiciones en toda la región, incluyendo los campos de personas desplazadas, siguen siendo terribles. Los recientes acontecimientos en regiones del norte como Alepo han desplazado a miles de personas más, y las condiciones invernales empeorarán las cosas.\\n\\nLa gente también está regresando a sus hogares, pero la mayoría solo está abandonando temporalmente los campos de personas desplazadas. La población regresa a los campos por muchas razones, entre ellas porque sus casas están destruidas, especialmente en las zonas rurales de Idlib y Alepo. Actualmente están a la espera de que sus casas sean reconstruidas por las autoridades y organizaciones.\\n\\nOtros obstáculos para que las personas permanezcan en sus hogares incluyen la falta de servicios esenciales como agua, electricidad y atención médica, debido a limitaciones escolares o financieras o porque están esperando mejores condiciones.\\n\\n## **2. La violencia en el noroeste ha empujado a la gente hacia el noreste**\\n\\nLa escalada en el noroeste de Siria comenzó cuando las facciones de la oposición (Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham) lanzaron una operación militar hacia Alepo y sus alrededores. A medida que el conflicto se intensificó en los primeros días de las operaciones, las facciones de la oposición (Ejército Nacional Sirio) atacaron Tal Rifaat, una ciudad llena de campos que albergan a personas desplazadas de la cercana Afrin.\\n\\nTras varios días de feroces combates, la oposición se hizo con el control de Tal Rifaat, lo que provocó la salida de unas 80,000 personas, la segunda vez que eran desplazadas.\\n\\nEstas personas ya han cruzado al noreste de Siria, llegando a Tabqa, Raqqa y Hassakeh, una región ya frágil que se enfrenta a importantes desafíos humanitarios. Entre ellos, un sistema sanitario que depende casi en su totalidad del apoyo y la [financiación internacionales](https://www.instagram.com/msf_mexico/p/C6uOtIHqB26/?img_index=1), que se ha recortado continuamente en los últimos años.\\n\\nMientras tanto, los enfrentamientos se han extendido a Manbij, al oeste de Raqqa, amenazando aún más a la región con otra ola de desplazamientos y una creciente inestabilidad.\\n\\n## **3. Respondemos en todo el norte, mientras intentamos evaluar otras áreas**\\n\\nLos equipos de Médicos Sin Fronteras están trabajando en el norte de Siria para responder a las necesidades. En el noroeste, continuamos brindando atención médica a las personas a través de nuestras clínicas móviles, centros de salud y hospitales existentes. Desde finales de noviembre, hemos donado equipos quirúrgicos y de traumatología a hospitales de todo el noroeste. También hemos proporcionado a cientos de familias kits de higiene, colchones y mantas.\\n\\nEn el noreste de Siria, seguimos brindando atención médica general, tratamiento para enfermedades no transmisibles y desnutrición, y apoyo en salud mental. También proporcionamos atención médica y agua en el campo de Al-Hol. En las últimas semanas, hemos distribuido más de 10,000 botellas de agua, 200 tiendas de campaña grandes, paquetes de fórmula infantil y pañales, mantas y colchones a los necesitados inmediatos en Tabqa, donde también pusimos en marcha una clínica móvil. Los equipos de MSF en Tabqa, Raqqa y Hassakeh también están abordando las necesidades de agua y saneamiento.\\n\\nMédicos Sin Fronteras no teníamos acceso a las zonas que estaban bajo el control del antiguo gobierno de Siria. Ahora estamos negociando con las nuevas autoridades de Damasco para garantizar el acceso a las zonas bajo el control del nuevo gobierno. Nuestros equipos están en contacto con organizaciones sanitarias y socios para evaluar las necesidades en otras partes de Siria y ver las posibilidades de trabajar en nuevas ubicaciones para aumentar nuestro apoyo médico y humanitario a las personas en Siria.', original_date='2024-12-23T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The United Nations (UN), I/NGOs and Syrian civil society will need to reset relations with the state and navigate emerging governance structures. There is an opportunity to learn from the last decade of divisive aid politics and aid economy. This paper aims to support the immediate resumption of aid delivery in Syria with a focus on two key issues: (1) How to navigate Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s emerging governance role, and; (2) How to start conversations on addressing Syria’s divisive aid economy. It concludes by setting out several points of discussion for Syrians, aid actors, and member states alike on solutions-oriented dialogue during this next phase in Syrian national politics. Proactive thinking on these issues has the potential to lay the foundations for transformative future recovery and development efforts in Syria.', original_date='2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='The New Syria: Implications and Uncertainties for International Responders and Donors', body='**Executive Summary**\\n\\n-   Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been ousted following opposition armed forces’ entry into the city of Damascus. The former President’s authoritarian system of governance and violent suppression of anti-government demonstrations during the Arab Spring are recognised as having contributed to the start and prolongment of Syria’s armed conflict.\\n\\n-   Succeeding his father’s 29-year long tenure, and having been in office for 24 years, Bashar al-Assad’s departure represents a paradigmatic shift for Syria’s near-term future, and also for the international aid response in Syria. Syria’s opposition factions now face the task of having to create a new governance model and restore stability at a time when the country is at its most vulnerable, while the aid system must adapt to lines of engagement that have been wholly redrawn by recent events.\\n\\n-   The implications of the Assad regime’s departure necessitate a comprehensive reassessment of existing strategies and programme approaches on the part of aid actors. The massive socio-political organisation now underway has not only introduced new humanitarian priorities, but produced new possibilities and problems of international engagement, to include the role(s) of the multi-partite opposition, challenges of social cohesion, issues around the control of key infrastructure and natural resources, probable impacts on the Syrian economy, contention around the operationalisation of key concepts like early recovery, and inevitable recalibrations around aid access, donor strategies, and aid fund design.\\n\\n-   For years, the aid and development community has operated under a series of assumptions which informed its operational strategies, resource allocations, and risk management frameworks for a Syria that was irretrievably under al-Assad. Many of those assumptions are now practically immaterial. While this is in some respects a ‘tabula rasa’ opportunity for the response community, the potential for shifting alliances, competing, ineffective, and/or malicious governance structures, and internecine conflict is equally a very real possibility and must be factored into future planning.', original_date='2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The project delivered services that improved animal health, enhanced productivity, and significantly bolstered the livelihoods of rural communities, directly benefiting 3,897 livestock breeders—818 of whom were women—over its extended lifecycle, and indirectly supporting 19,485 individuals.\\n\\nAs part of its outcomes, three Agriculture and Livestock Centres (ALSCs) were upgraded and equipped, while two new mobile clinics were introduced to complement an existing clinic from Phase I. These facilities ensured improved access to subsidized fodder, high-quality vaccines, and veterinary services for remote farmers. Over 104,000 animals were vaccinated, surpassing the project’s target and reducing livestock losses by 94%, as reported by beneficiaries.\\n\\nAdditionally, the intervention delivered capacity-building programs for 62 local technicians through four comprehensive training modules. The creation of the Syrian Agri-Vet Technicians Association established a sustainable framework for veterinary care and technical assistance to breeders. The use of climate-smart technology, including three weather stations and the launch of the innovative \"VetSyria\" Tele-Med application, further enhanced the sector’s resilience to climate change and improved access to expert consultations.\\n\\nBeyond the direct impact on livestock health, this intervention also contributed to the local economy by sourcing inputs from local markets and employing a cost-recovery approach, generating USD 573,515 through input sales. Moreover, the project demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by incorporating solar energy solutions into its facilities.\\n\\nIn an interview, a male farmer shared:  \\n*\"The veterinary clinic near our residence has provided much-needed stability, allowing us to care for our livestock without traveling far. It has improved our income and given us hope for a better future.\"*\\n\\nA female farmer added:  \\n*\"The quality of the vaccines and services is excellent. The affordability and proximity have significantly reduced our expenses, giving us peace of mind and stability for our families.\"*\\n\\nWith a revised budget of EUR 1.6 million and EUR 239,352.81 released back to other SRTF projects, this intervention not only strengthened Ar-Raqqa’s livestock sector but also empowered rural communities by reducing financial burdens, preventing negative coping mechanisms, and restoring economic stability. The impact of this intervention will be further evaluated through an independent assessment in 2025, ensuring continued learning and improvement for future phases.\\n\\n**For more information about this intervention, visit:**\\n\\n[Support to Livestock Farmers in Ar-Raqqa Governorate – Phase II](https://www.srtfund.org/projects/719-support-to-livestock-farmers-in-ar-raqqa-governorate-phase-ii)\\n\\n**For more information on the SRTF visit:**\\n\\n[http://www.srtfund.org](http://www.srtfund.org)\\n\\n**Media outlets may contact:**\\n\\n[communications@srtfund.org](https://reliefweb.int/mailto:communications@srtfund.org)', original_date='2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The SCPR had developed a methodology for building a price index based on components of consumer basket, weighting, and market selection (See [SCPR’s Consumer Price Index in Syria](https://scpr-syria.org/scprs-annual-bulletin-for-consumer-price-index-and-inflation-in-syria-2022/))\\n\\nThis bulletin presents the findings of the monthly consumer price survey and the changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for **December 2024** (with 2021 as the base year) broken down by region and the major consumption groups. Based on the CPI changes, the bulletin provides an estimate of the cost of living and poverty lines at the local level in all Syrian regions.\\n\\n**The following results are highlighted:**\\n\\n- Between November 27, 2024, and December 8, 2024, Syria witnessed a large-scale attack by the “Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham” forces and their allied factions on areas controlled by the Syrian regime, as part of the “Battle of Deterring Aggression.” The Syrian regime’s army collapsed quickly during this battle, and the Hay’at forces managed to seize control of all the provinces that were under the regime’s control. On the morning of December 8, 2024, the Syrian people officially announced the end of a dark era of the previous regime’s tyranny, after a struggle that lasted more than 14 years, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dead, wounded, and missing.\\n- The consumer price index witnessed an inflationary shock during December 2024, as the monthly inflation rate (M-o-M) reached 15.1 per cent within Syria during December 2024 compared to November 2024, and the annual inflation rate (Y-o-Y) reached 49.7 per cent.\\n- The consumer price index recorded a significant decline in most major consumption groups, with the exception of the Transportation group and the Housing, Water, Electricity, and Gas group, which witnessed an unprecedented rise since August 2023. The monthly inflation rate for the Transportation group reached 45 per cent during December 2024 compared to the previous month, and the monthly inflation rate for the Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and other fuel groups reached 41.7 per cent.\\n- The main reasons for the inflationary shock that occurred in December 2024 are summarized as follows: 1) The decision to raise the prices of subsidized bread on the one hand, and 2) The decisions to liberalize the prices of diesel, gasoline, and domestic gas on the other hand, which directly affected transportation costs, and will have a future impact on the costs of agricultural and industrial production.\\n- Assuming that the new government did not take its decisions regarding the liberalization of fuel prices and raising the price of subsidized bread (the continuity scenario), the price index at the whole of Syria would have reached 722 instead of 853 (base year 2021), and prices would have decreased by an average of 2.5 per cent compared to November 2024.\\n- The governorates that were under the control of the Syrian government recorded the highest levels of monthly inflation (M-o-M) during December 2024, with rates ranging between 11.2 per cent and 24.4 per cent, led by the governorates of Hama and Quneitra with a monthly inflation rate of 24.4 per cent for each, followed by the governorate of Tartous with a rate of 23.5 per cent, then the governorate of As-Sweida with a rate of 22.7 per cent, then the governorate of Homs with a rate of 22.4 per cent, On the other hand, Idleb recorded a 1 per cent decrease in CPI, while Ar-Raqqa saw a decline of 0.6 per cent, and Al-Hasakeh by 0.3 per cent.\\n- In December 2024, the Housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuel oils group contributed significantly to the monthly inflation (with 15.1 per cent), making up 91.1 per cent of the total, followed by the Transportation group with a contribution of 19.7 per cent. While the Food and Non-alcoholic Beverages group contributed to reducing the inflation rate by 8 per cent during December 2024.\\n- The inflation witnessed by the country in December 2024 led to a decrease in the real wages of government employees by 14.6 per cent, and by 12 per cent for workers in the private and civil sectors compared to November 2024. However, the salaries of government employees in GoS areas, numbering 1.25 million workers, were not disbursed during December 2024. Despite the Syrian Interim Caretaker Government promising a 400 per cent wage increase when it raised the bread and fuel prices.\\n- In December 2024, the abject poverty line for families (as an indicator of food deprivation) reached SYP 3.08 million per month within Syria, an increase of SYP 154 thousand compared to November 2024. The lower poverty line reached SYP 4.84 million, an increase of SYP 243 thousand compared to the previous month. The upper poverty line reached SYP 6.68 million, an increase of SYP 335 thousand compared to the last month.\\n- When comparing nominal wages (at current prices) with monthly poverty lines, it becomes clear that the wage gap from the abject poverty line reached 77 per cent for university-educated employees in the public sector, 63.3 per cent for workers in the private sector, and 2.3 per cent for the workers in the civil sector during December 2024.', original_date='2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The Human Rights Council has repeatedly extended the Commission's mandate since then, most recently until 31 March 2025.*\\n\\n***More information** on the work of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria can be found here, and its recent specialized reports on violations committed in detention facilities can be found here and here.*\\n\\n***For media requests, please contact:** Johan Eriksson, UN Syria Commission of Inquiry Media Adviser, at +41 76 691 0411 / johan.eriksson@un.org; or Todd Pitman, Media Adviser, Investigative Missions, at +41766911761 / todd.pitman@un.org; Pascal Sim, Human Rights Council Media Officer at +41229179763 / simp@un.org.*\\n\\nفریق لجنة التحقیق التابعة للأمم المتحدة یزور سوریا، ویرحب بالإشارات المشجعة من قبل السلطات الجدیدة للانخراط في قضایا حقوق الإنسان، ویحث على حمایة المقابر الجماعیة والأدلة\\n\\n**كانون الاول/دیسمبر 2024 20**\\n\\nتلقى أعضاء فریق التحقیق التابع للأمم المتحدة في انتھاكات حقوق الإنسان في سوریا معلومات جدیدة عن مرافق -**جنیف** الاحتجاز ومواقع المقابر الجماعیة التابعة للحكومة السابقة خلال زیارتھم الأولى إلى البلاد منذ أن أنشأ مجلس حقوق الإنسان .التحقیق في عام 2011\\n\\nوشكلت ھذه الزیارة الأولى داخل البلاد بدایة جدیدة محتملة لتعاون أكبر مع اللجنة وكذلك مع الھیئات الوطنیة والدولیة الأخرى .المعنیة بحقوق الإنسان\\n\\nوزار فریق اللجنة السجون ومراكز الاحتجاز السابقة، بما في ذلك سجن صیدنایا وفرع المخابرات العسكریة 235 )”فرع فلسطین“(. وقد شعرالفریق بالأسف عندما رأى أن الكثیر من الأدلة والوثائق التي یمكن أن تساعد العائلات على اكتشاف أماكن .وجود أحبائھم المختفین واستخدامھا كأدلة في عملیات المساءلة في المستقبل قد تعرضت للتلف أو التدمیر أو تم أخذھا\\n\\nوفي بعض الحالات، تم إضرام النار في مخازن كبیرة من الوثائق وحرقھا. كانت العائلات في بعض ھذه المواقع تقوم بتمشیط .ما تبقى من وثائق، على أمل العثور على أي أدلة على مصیر أحبائھم\\n\\nولاحظ الفریق أیضاً وجود عدد كبیر من الوثائق التي لا تزال قابلة للإنقاذ، وتلقى معلومات تفید بأن ھناك سجلات إضافیة تم .حفظھا في مواقع أخرى، إما في الموقع من قبل حكومة تصریف الأعمال أو في أماكن أخرى من قبل منظمات المجتمع المدني\\n\\nكما علم الفریق أیضاً أن عملیات استخراج الجثث من المقابر الجماعیة قد بدأت بالفعل، سواء من قبل منظمات الإنقاذ أو من قبل .بعض ألاشخاص\\n\\nوحذرت اللجنة من أن الإجراءات المتخذة الآن، حتى لو كانت حسنة النیة، قد تعقّد الجھود المستقبلیة لتحدید ھویة الأشخاص الذین فُقدوا وإیجاد حل لعائلاتھم. یجب توخي أقصى درجات الحذر لحمایة مواقع المقابر الجماعیة وحمایة جمیع الوثائق والأدلة .في جمیع أنحاء سوریا\\n\\nوللمساعدة في ذلك، اقترحت اللجنة أن تنشئ الحكومة الجدیدة وحدة لقیادة وتنسیق حمایة مواقع المقابر الجماعیة والحفاظ علیھا وعلى جمیع الوثائق ذات الصلة، إلى أن یحین الوقت الذي یمكن فیھ للخبراء السوریین والدولیین فحصھا واستخراج الجثث .والرفات بشكل جنائي، لحمایة حق العائلات في معرفة الحقیقة\\n\\nوقد عرضت العدید من الكیانات الحقوقیة والإنسانیة الوطنیة والدولیة المساعدة في ھذا المسعى، لحمایة الوثائق والمواقع  \\n المتعلقة بالجرائم المحتملة - سواء لعملیات المساءلة في المستقبل أو للضرورة الإنسانیة المتمثلة في تحدید أماكن المفقودین ودعم .أسرھم\\n\\nوفي الوقت نفسھ، اقترحت اللجنة أن تصدر الحكومة إعلانات مناسبة على أعلى مستوى من خلال قنوات الاتصال العامة تطالب الجمھور بالامتناع عن المساس بھذه المواقع، وأن یتم إعادة أي وثائق أو أدلة تم أخذھا، مع الإشارة إلى أن ذلك سیسھل عملیات .العدالة والمساءلة التي ستتبع في الأشھر والسنوات المقبلة\\n\\nفي ھذه اللحظة الحاسمة في تاریخ سوریا، وفي وقت یتوقع فیھ الشعب السوري الكثیر، تعید اللجنة تأكید تضامنھا الكامل مع .الشعب السوري بأسره، وتؤكد استعدادھا لدعمھ بأي وسیلة ممكنة\\n\\nانتھى\\n\\nأُنشأت لجنة التحقیق الدولیة المستقلة بشأن الجمھوریة العربیة السوریة بتاریخ 22 أغسطس/آب 2011 من طرف :**خلفیة** وتتمثل ولایة اللجنة في التحقیق بشأن كل الانتھاكات المزعومة لقانون حقوق .**17/1-S**مجلس حقوق الإنسان بموجب القرار\\n\\nالإنسان المرتكبة منذ آذار/مارس 2011 في الجمھوریة العربیة السوریة. وكلف مجلس حقوق الإنسان اللجنة كذلك بإثبات الوقائع والظروف التي قد ترقى إلى مثل تلك الانتھاكات والخاصة بالجرائم المرتكبة مع القیام، حیثما أمكن، بتحدید الجناة بھدف التأكد من مساءلة المسؤولین عن تلك الانتھاكات، بما في ذلك تلك التي قد ترقى إلى الجرائم ضد الإنسانیة. مجلس حقوق الإنسان .قد مدد ولایة اللجنة مرا ًرا منذ ذلك الحین، وآخرھا حتى 31 مارس 2025\\n\\n**احصل على معلومات إضافیة** بشأن عمل **لجنة الأمم المتحدة للتحقیق بشأن سوریا**، ویمكن العثور على تقاریرھا المتخصصة .و**ھنا** الأخیرة حول الانتھاكات التي ارتكبت في مرافق الاحتجاز **ھنا**\\n\\n**:للرد على طلبات وسائل الإعلام، یرجى الاتصال**  \\n یوھان إریكسون، المستشار الإعلامي للجنة الأمم المتحدة للتحقیق بشأن سوریا،\\n\\n+41 76 691 0411 / **johan.eriksson@un.org** تود بیتمان، المستشار الإعلامي لدى وحدة دعم آلیات التحقیق،\\n\\n+41 76 691 17 61 / **todd.pitman@un.org**\\n\\nباسكال سیم، مسؤول إعلامي لمجلس حقوق الإنسان،\\n\\n\\\\+ 41 22 917 9763 / **simp@un.org**\", original_date='2024-12-30T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='Opening Detention Centers Has Revealed the Still-Going Humanitarian Catastrophe: Over 112,414 Individuals Are Still Forcibly Disappeared at the Hands of the Assad Regime [EN/AR]', body='**The Hague - Syrian Network for Human Rights:**\\n\\nDecember 28, 2024 – The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) released a new statement that sheds light on still-going humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Assad regime’s arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearance practices even after all the former regime’s detention centers were opened. The statement stresses that, as SNHR’s database shows, at least 112,414 individuals of the people forcibly disappeared by the Assad regime are still missing, even with the release of thousands of detainees in recent weeks.\\n\\nThe statement alludes to the releases that took place as soon as the major cities were captured in the course of Operation Deter Aggression that was launched by the Military Operations Command. The offensive led to the capture of the cities of Aleppo, Hama, Homs, and Damascus. As such, with all prisons and detention centers opened, all the detainees had been released. SNHR’s teams in Syria closely monitored these releases, and have, in fact, been in contact with hundreds of released detainees and their families in order to document recent developments and collect more information.\\n\\nSNHR’s systematic efforts in documenting arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearance\\n\\nSince 2011, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) has spared no effort to document cases of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearance. To that end, a dedicated team within SNHR has been assigned specifically to working solely on this issue, drawing upon accounts from survivors and victims’ families, as well as other documents and evidence. SNHR successfully developed an advanced and comprehensive database containing accurate information about detainees and forcibly disappeared persons, including their potential fate, while ensuring that the data was continuously updated in order to ensure the publication of reliable and accurate figures and reports.\\n\\nEvidence proving systematic crimes\\n\\nDespite the release of thousands of detainees, the statement notes that the overwhelming majority of forcibly disappeared persons died under torture, or due to the brutal detention conditions, or were summarily executed. In reaching this conclusion, SNHR has relied on definitive items of evidence, including:\\n\\n**1. Forcibly disappeared persons had been registered as dead in the civil registry records:** From 2018 onwards, the Assad regime registered thousands of forcibly disappeared persons as dead without returning their bodies to their families or properly informing their families of the details of their death.\\n\\n**2. Mass death sentences:** The report reveals that verified data shows that mass death sentences were issued against thousands of forcibly disappeared persons, especially in detention centers such as Sednaya Military Prison.\\n\\n**3. The number of those released:** After the prisons were opened, an estimated 24,200 individuals were freed. Still, as SNHR’s database attest, the number of detainees and forcibly disappeared persons classified as being imprisoned in the Assad regime’s detention centers as of August 2024 was 136,614, meaning that 112,414 individuals are still missing.\\n\\n**4. Mass graves were found**: In recent weeks, a number of mass graves were found containing the bodies/remains of thousands of victims who were extrajudicially executed, reflecting the systematic and staggering crimes committed by the Assad regime.\\n\\nSNHR must stress, however, that these individuals are still classified as **forcibly disappeared persons** since their bodies have not been returned to their families, and their fates have not been conclusively clarified. It will take intensive and continuous efforts to reveal the full truth about the fate of each of these victims. This should be done in the framework of holding those responsible for these crimes accountable, while the victims and their families must be fairly and properly compensated.\\n\\n**Urgent recommendations to address this issue**\\n\\nThe statement stresses that urgent and practical steps must be taken to address this humanitarian issue, most notably:\\n\\n- **Fully reveal the fate of forcibly disappeared persons:** Independent and transparent investigation must be launched to ascertain the details of these disappearances and identify those responsible for these crimes.\\n- **Hold the perpetrators accountable:** Ensure that all of those responsible, whether at the political or security level, are held to account.\\n- **Provide psychological and social support for families:** Provide social and psychological rehabilitation programs to the families who lost their loved ones.\\n- **Respect international treaties:** The statement calls on the new Syrian government to respect international treaties, such as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.\\n\\n**Call to the international community**\\n\\nSNHR calls on the international community to intensify its efforts to ensure accountability and justice for the victims and their families, as well as to promote human rights protection in Syria.', original_date='2024-12-28T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='Syria Update #12 - 20 December 2024', body='## As of 20:00, 19 December 2024\\n\\n**A series of political appointments announced this week by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leader Ahmad al-Shara’a (otherwise known by his** ***nom de guerre*** **Abu Muhammad al-Jolani) are stirring unease across different sectors of Syrian society. Governor positions in Latakia and Rural Damascus have been handed to commanders from allied radical Islamist militia Ahrar al-Sham, a move that is being interpreted by some observers as an attempt to award key posts to militant commanders in exchange for their loyalty. The latest appointments follow a series of crucial positions going to other HTS insiders earlier in the week, suggesting that al-Jolani might prioritize factional loyalty over competence in governance in his interim administration moving forward, as opposed to working towards an inclusive, representative and civilian-led process.**\\n\\n**The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) continue to face threats to their control over much of the north-east, with defections, assassinations and difficulties in paying salaries compounding external threats on multiple fronts from Türkiye and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). SDF/SNA clashes have also continued around the Tishreen Dam in rural Manbij.**\\n\\n**Evidence is mounting of the unimaginable scale of regime atrocities within detention centers over the past 14 years. A recently discovered mass grave in Al-Qutayfah, 40 kilometers north of Damascus, is thought to contain over 100,000 bodies, while other sites are currently being unearthed near Adra, Al-Husseiniyeh, Sayeda Zeinab and along the Damascus Airport Road.**\\n\\n### Interim Administration\\n\\nAfter Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) unveiled a series of key political appointments over the past week, its initial governance steps have elicited anger and apprehension among different sectors of Syrian society who view the picks as undermining moves towards an inclusive, competent civilian-led administration. Many of the new appointments have elicited accusations of cronyism and patronage, after positions were doled out to members of allied armed groups likely in a bid to secure loyalty towards HTS leader al-Jolani. Of particular concern are the granting of governor roles to allied radical militia leaders from Ahrar al-Sham, including Amer Sheikh as governor of Rural Damascus and Hassan Soufan as governor of Latakia. Both are close political associates of HTS and al-Jolani.\\n\\nAnother troubling recent appointment was that of Maher al-Shara’a, the brother of al-Jolani, as minister of health. Although al-Shara’a, a gynecologist by trade, held a similar position in the HTS-controlled Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) in Idlib, the optics of the appointment have attracted some comparisons with the recently ousted Assad regime, in which a tight inner circle of relatives and insiders maintained an iron grip over key cabinet and security postings.\\n\\n### North-East Syria\\n\\nThe Turkish-backed SNA’s *Fajr al-Hurriyeh* operations room has continued to make gains into SDF territory over the past week, with clashes with the SDF intensifying around the Tishreen Dam in rural Manbij and in Karakozak near Kobani. Meanwhile, the SDF are struggling to contain defections from among their ranks in Hasakeh and Raqqa, developments that could weaken the group’s ability to defend frontlines in western and southern areas of the north-east. Kurdish forces are also facing a rising number of political assassinations targeting SDF commanders, while leadership is also under pressure to hasten reunification talks with the new authorities in Damascus.\\n\\n### Central Syria\\n\\nWith attention focused elsewhere, ISIS cells have started increasing their activities in the northern Palmyra countryside. Attacks against oil workers and local tribes also increased, with at least six killed and others injured in a string of recent attacks.\\n\\nWithin the 55km zone, some families from Rukban returned to their villages in recent days. Efforts are underway to arrange transports for families choosing to return, and local authorities are coordinating with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) to facilitate the process.\\n\\n### North-West Syria\\n\\nProtests have continued in the city of Idlib as family members and other supporters of individuals detained by HTS gathered in public squares to demand their release. HTS has a long history in north-west Syria of detaining individuals for criticism of the group and its leadership, with dozens of arrests in recent months targeting media figures, political activists and local dignitaries.\\n\\nNorth-west Syria has also begun to see increased aid flows and a pivot towards preliminary reconstruction in heavily damaged districts. Seventy trucks carrying UN-supplied humanitarian aid entered through the Bab al-Hawa crossing for distribution across the country, while groups cleared rubble from entrances to Ma’arat al-Numan, distributed free bread and encouraged displaced families to return.\\n\\n### Security Developments\\n\\nThe general state of law and order continues to pose a significant challenge to interim authorities, with police stations still severely understaffed and factional fighters spread thin, as HTS struggles to manage the enormous new territory under its effective control. Government services and utilities are gradually resuming, with hopeful signs of a return to administrative normalcy in some areas. The first airplane landed at Aleppo International Airport from Damascus, carrying journalists, media personnel and officials, while Aleppo’s Passports and Immigration Department resumed issuing of pre-prepared passports. Several police stations across Damascus have also been reactivated.\\n\\n### Former Regime Violations\\n\\nWhile public celebrations celebrating the Assad regime’s collapse have continued, shocking evidence of regime atrocities is emerging on an almost daily basis. In Al-Qutayfah, 40 kilometers north of the capital, civil defense teams uncovered mass graves holding at least 100,000 bodies of victims previously held in Sednaya and security branches, who were buried between 2012 and 2018. Other mass graves were discovered near Adra, Al-Husseiniyeh, Sayeda Zeinab and along the Damascus Airport Road—all in Rural Damascus.

       " ReliefArticle(title='Syria Update #11 - 17 December 2024', body='## As of 16:30, 17 December 2024\\n\\n**Syria’s delicate interim period is still defined by the very real threat of unrest and open hostilities in north-east Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are facing sustained challenges to their control over north-east Syria. Its fighters have already begun tactical withdrawals from communities in Deir Ezzor, which the group took from retreating regime forces in early December. Local protests in Raqqa demanding the SDF’s removal turned into violent clashes when forces opened fire on protesters, adding to the long-simmering tensions between local Arab tribes and Kurdish forces. In a sign of the unprecedented precarity the group finds itself in, the Kurdish-led Self Administration presented a roadmap designed to de-escalate hostilities in favor of negotiations with interim authorities in Damascus.**\\n\\n**In south Syria, Israel is maintaining its unilateral occupation of territory in the border strip and Quneitra, manning checkpoints and conducting raids within urban areas to seek out former Hezbollah and Syrian army weapons stores and infrastructure in the region. Israeli airstrikes continue to pound Syria, causing huge explosions in Damascus and Tartous.**\\n\\n**Following tense negotiations with Ahmad al-Awdeh and other representatives of south-west Syria’s armed groups, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS) military forces assumed effective control of the coveted Nassib crossing linking south Syria with Jordan.**\\n\\n### North-East Syria\\n\\nUnrest is spreading across north-east Syria, where some communities are demanding the withdrawal of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Long-standing tensions escalated last week when protests against the group in central Raqqa turned into clashes between residents and SDF fighters, leaving several people dead and more than 22 others injured. In response, the SDF has kept up a wave of arrests targeting alleged participants in demonstrations, with up to 70 people taken into custody so far.\\n\\nAfter losing Manbij to advancing forces from the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) last week, the SDF withdrew from the Tishreen Dam area of the Manbij countryside over the weekend. Forces from the SNA’s *Fajr al-Hurriyeh* (Dawn of Freedom) operations room subsequently entered the area without clashes.\\n\\nWith the SDF and Kurdish-led Self Administration arguably in their most precarious position since taking over control of much of the north-east after 2018, the Self Administration presented a so-called “Syrian Dialogue Initiative” meant to chart a course out of the current situation. The 10-point document calls for (amongst other things) an emergency meeting in Damascus to discuss transition with interim authorities and to preserve the unity and sovereignty of Syrian territory—including by protecting them from attacks by Türkiye.\\n\\n### Damascus\\n\\nUN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen visited Damascus over the weekend—his first trip to the Syrian capital since Bashar al-Assad’s fall—and met with HTS leader Ahmad al-Shara’a, otherwise known by his *nom de guerre* Abu Muhammad al-Jolani. Pedersen stressed to al-Jolani that UN Resolution 2254 must form the backbone of the coming transitional process, emphasizing the need for economic renewal as another key part of transition and conflict resolution efforts moving forward. The meeting prompted optimism amongst Syrians inside the country, with many expressing hopes these measures can be implemented meaningfully on the ground.\\n\\nPedersen’s visit came on the back of an Arab Ministerial Contact Committee summit on Syria in Aqaba, Jordan, which included foreign ministers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt as well as the Arab League’s secretary-general; foreign ministers from the US, Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, France and the European Union, and ambassadors from the UK and Germany, also attended. A first step in diplomatically acknowledging the post-Assad reality in Damascus, international states tended to focus discussions on immediate concerns—including the need for a genuine, representative transition in Syria and an end to Israeli incursions into Syria.\\n\\nDespite mounting international engagement with Syria, there are growing concerns about the lack of inclusivity displayed by HTS-led authorities in Damascus when it comes to governance—either by not including a broad spectrum of parties in decision-making or displaying a lack of interest in reaching compromises. Ministers from the HTS-affiliated Syrian Salvation Government (SSG), which governed Idlib until recently, are increasingly being installed in Damascus, bringing with them handfuls of senior directors from Idlib—even if they are underqualified figures with little experience.\\n\\nHTS-led authorities have sought to reinstate a sense of order in and around the capital, reactivating former regime checkpoints stationed on main roads and clearing left-behind military vehicles and destroyed cars that littered the city in the wake of the former regime’s collapse. As seen in other areas of the country, volunteer teams are still cleaning streets in and around Damascus due to the shortage of sanitation workers and infrastructure, although there has been a partial return to work of garbage trucks in the capital in recent days.\\n\\n### Israeli Attacks & Incursions\\n\\nWhile Israel has already occupied the demilitarized border strip between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syrian-controlled areas of Quneitra, Israeli forces are continuing regular incursions into Quneitra province. Israeli forces have also continued its campaign of airstrikes across Syria, which have effectively wiped out Syrian army weapons stocks and capabilities. On Sunday alone, Israeli forces launched more than 50 raids across Syria—including one in Mneen, a few kilometers to the north of Damascus, that destroyed a weapons storage warehouse. Massive airstrikes in Latakia and Tartous on the same night also reportedly targeted weapons stores and air defense sites.\\n\\n### South-West Syria\\n\\nHTS is currently working to establish its control in Daraa by placing affiliated officials and close allies in senior governorate-level and administrative civilian positions. In a significant move, HTS also took control of the Nassib-Jaber crossing linking Syria with Jordan. HTS’ consolidation in the south has been accompanied by tense negotiations between al-Jolani and Ahmad al-Awdeh, former commander of Southern Front faction Shabab al-Sunna and the 5th Corps’ 8th Brigade.\\n\\n### North-West Syria\\n\\nTürkiye’s minister of interior announced that around 9,000 Syrian refugees travelled to north-west Syria via the Bab al-Salameh and Bab al-Hawa crossings in the past week. However, it remains unclear how many of this group were returnees planning to return permanently to Syria or, for example, others conducting scouting visits to their origin communities in the north-west. Even then, in spite of the removal of Assad and the widespread hope among Syrians who saw the former regime as an obstacle to their safe return, it is still far too premature to upturn existing policies on asylum, reception and return for Syrian refugees in neighboring countries or hosting countries in Europe.', original_date='2024-12-17T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The appearance of newly appointed ministers in front of the revolutionary flag and HTS’ factional flag has done little to assuage these concerns.\\n\\n### Israeli Attacks, Occupation of Syrian Territory\\n\\nImmediately after Assad’s fall, Israel launched a massive military campaign against all military assets on Syrian territory, all while breaching the 1974 demilitarization agreement between the two countries and seizing further swathes of territory along the border strip with the occupied Golan Heights. An unprecedented wave of hundreds of airstrikes targeted military bases across the country, virtually destroying Syria’s entire defense infrastructure of the country in a matter of days.

These interconnected challenges demand a cohesive regional humanitarian and protection response.\\n\\nThe crisis in Syria stands as the deadliest conflict of the 21st century and one of the largest displacement emergencies in the world.(1) Forced to relocate beyond the country’s borders, over 6 million Syrians have become refugees while even more are internally displaced.(2) Before the crisis, 560,000 Palestine refugees were registered with UNRWA in Syria. Today, 438,000 remain of whom 40 per cent are internally displaced,(3) while one fifth have left. This includes 44,202 Palestine refugees displaced to neighbouring countries, with 20,324 in Jordan and 23,878 in Lebanon.(4) Following a prolonged impasse in the political process, the armed opposition in Syria launched a major offensive on 27 November. In the week that followed, over 1,000,000 people displaced.(5) On 8 December, as this Appeal was nearing publication, the government of Bashar alAssad fell, thousands of political detainees were released and a new caretaker administration assumed control.\\n\\nIn a moment filled with profound hope, thousands of the 5.6 million refugees in countries bordering Syria, along with many more displaced within the country, began their journey home. As the caretaker authorities worked to restore law and order, Israel intensified military action on Syrian soil and in the region. The transitional administration will have to consolidate governance and rebuild essential health, education and water systems, against substantial challenges to regional stability, military action on Syrian territory, and a crippling inherited economic crisis.\\n\\nThe vast majority of the newly displaced in Syria, whether internally displaced or fleeing recent violence in Lebanon, have initially sought shelter with family and friends, already unable to meet their own needs.(6) Even before the latest surges in local and regional violence, nearly 90 per cent of Palestine refugees in Syria lived on less than US$ 2.15 per person, per day, with 62 per cent suffering from food insecurity.(7) Malnutrition among children under five has doubled in the past two years.(8) Economic pressures (i.e., the prohibitive cost of rent in protracted displacement) have forced some of the most vulnerable Palestine refugees to return to damaged homes in Yarmouk, Ein el Tal and Dera’a Palestine refugee camps where they live in the midst of destroyed buildings and decimated water, sewage and energy infrastructure.(9) Approximately 30 per cent of populated areas in Syria, including Palestine refugee camps, remain affected by explosive remnants of war (ERW).(10)\\n\\nIn Lebanon, which has the highest refugee density per capita in the world, individual and community resilience is stretched to the breaking point amid chronic poverty, socioeconomic exclusion and escalating social tensions.(11) Palestine refugees, among the most vulnerable in this context, face entrenched structural marginalization on an intergenerational scale, with Palestinian refugees from Syria (PRS) enduring further hardship, as the renewal of their residency permits was halted as of May 2024. Eighty per cent of Palestine refugees in Lebanon live below the national poverty line, a figure that would stand at over 90 per cent in the absence of emergency cash assistance provided by UNRWA.(12)\\n\\nSince September 2024, Lebanon has experienced its most severe conflict in two decades, triggered by heightened violence between Israel and Hezbollah, related to the war in Gaza. This conflict has destroyed homes, health facilities and water systems in the country. Nearly 900,000 people have been internally displaced,(13) with around 600,000 forced to seek safety in Syria,(14) including thousands of Palestine refugees, both those registered in Lebanon and those originally from Syria. Many are from vulnerable backgrounds, such as femaleheaded households and those already reliant on humanitarian aid.(15) Despite the conditional ceasefire of 27 November 2024, the overall situation remains precarious. Armed exchanges between the parties to the conflict continue.\\n\\nIn Jordan, the regional escalation of hostilities, relating to the conflict in Gaza, has negatively impacted the national socioeconomic landscape and heightened security risks.(16) Those most affected are among Jordan’s most vulnerable, including PRS, Palestinian refugees from Lebanon (PRL), Palestinian refugees from Iraq (PRI), as well as Gazans stranded in Jordan following the events of 7 October 2023,(17) and ex-Gazans(18) faced with limited access to public services due to documentation barriers. Jordan already hosts the second largest refugee population per capita in the world.(19) Rises in the cost of living further challenge the country’s capacity to manage influx of crisis-affected populations and push more Palestine refugees and other at-risk groups into deeper vulnerability.\\n\\nIn response to these overlapping and interlinked protracted crises and new shocks, through regionally coherent and coordinated assistance modalities under the 2025 Emergency Appeal (EA), UNRWA will continue to adapt its response to meet the evolving needs of those affected, ensuring humanitarian assistance reaches the most vulnerable. The Agency will provide cash assistance to over 600,000 vulnerable Palestine refugees across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to meet their most basic needs in a flexible and dignified manner. UNRWA will extend rapid transitional shelter support to up to over 57,000 Palestine refugees in Syria and Lebanon, displaced by recent surges in conflict. A further 6,800 Palestine refugee in Syria will receive shelter support for more substantial repairs using the self-help approach, with the support of UNRWA engineering oversight.\\n\\nAddressing the risks affecting the sustainability of returns to Palestine refugee camps, targeted shelter and protection interventions will be critical to promoting more durable solutions. In this regard, UNRWA will provide explosive ordnance risk education (EORE) to over 52,000 individuals in high-risk areas in Syria and Lebanon to enhance their safety and awareness. Across all three fields of UNRWA operations under this emergency appeal, Agency legal aid and referrals will assist 13,520 Palestine refugees, particularly those lacking official documentation and facing barriers to access essential services and legal protections. In addition, over 73,000 refugees will benefit from winterization assistance or anticipatory actions to help them withstand harsh weather conditions, including winter flooding.\\n\\nThrough the 2025 EA, the Agency will prioritize the adaptation of primary health care services to meet the demands of evolving emergencies, including increased nutrition response needs, as well as maintaining education during crises. Across all three fields, nearly 123,000 Palestine refugees, including nearly 82,000 children enrolled in UNRWA schools, will receive psychosocial support (PSS) associated with conflict, displacement and economic hardship, which expose them to trauma, stress and disrupted development.\\n\\nUNRWA will also rehabilitate installations damaged by conflict in Syria and Lebanon to ensure service continuity in a dignified and safe environment. Maintenance and repairs will be carried out on over 200 UNRWA facilities across all three fields, including upgrades for accessibility and the installation of sustainable energy systems at critical installations, to enhance longer term environmental sustainability, as well as immediate operational capacity during emergencies.\\n\\nThe crises in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan are deeply interconnected, presenting compound challenges that require a cohesive regional approach to humanitarian and protection response. In this regard, UNRWA will be prepared to maintain, adapt and scale up emergency service provision, as required. In alignment with the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, the Agency will enhance collaboration with development and peacebuilding actors to address the root causes of vulnerability and promote more sustainable solutions for Palestine refugees. UNRWA will also develop humanitarian early recovery efforts to promote more sustainable solutions in Syria, while safeguarding legal status and key protection mechanisms across the region. Further, the Agency will strengthen partnerships with Member States, humanitarian actors and development organizations to ensure coordinated, impactful and sustainable support for Palestine refugees. These measures are essential to protecting and upholding the rights of the most vulnerable Palestine refugees during this period of profound change.\\n\\nThe stability of countries in the region, including Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, is deeply interconnected with that of their neighbours, carrying significant regional implications. Consequently, a unified regional response not only strengthens cohesion but also fosters recovery and stability across borders. Through this Appeal, UNRWA calls on Member States and partners to extend sustained and meaningful support to Palestine refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. This commitment is vital to protect their survival, dignity and resilience during this period.\\n\\n**endnotes**\\n\\n1.

       " ReliefArticle(title='Syria Needs a Coordinated Strategy To Find Missing Persons [EN/AR]', body='**The Hague, 24 December 2024:** There is a window of opportunity to achieve an objective in Syria that was unimaginable just a month ago – to locate and identify tens of thousands of Syrians who are missing as a result of decades of repression, conflict and mass displacement.\\n\\nEstimates of the number of missing range from 100,000 to 200,000. It is critical that any process to locate these people and investigate their disappearance is led by Syria and that the authorities place the interests and rights of families of the missing front and center. An effective process will establish the fate of missing persons, secure the human rights of survivors and victims and lay the groundwork for holding perpetrators to account.\\n\\nGiven that the majority of missing persons are men, Syrian women, who constitute the majority of survivors, must play a leading role in driving the missing persons process forward and they must be central to the strategy that is formed.\\n\\nThe building blocks of such a process do not have to be devised from scratch. As has been said many times, this conflict is one of the most comprehensively documented in history – not least because many brave Syrians have collected data and documented atrocities over the last decade, in many cases risking their lives to do so. This documentation will be essential now.\\n\\nThe first step is to protect mass graves and places of detention so that evidence can be gathered systematically and to a standard that will make it possible to present this evidence at future war crimes trials.\\n\\nThe next step is for Syria, with the support of international experts, including forensic anthropologists and archeologists, to conduct judicial investigations in all cases, collecting and collating verifiable information on crimes and crime scenes, and on perpetrators and victims. With the support of Syrian civil society organizations (CSOs) and international organizations, an integrated data system must be created so that data on missing persons and sites of forensic interest, including mass graves, can be verified and used to help Syria create a Central Record of all missing persons.\\n\\nThese steps will be properly supported if international organizations pool their expertise and their resources and agree on a missing persons assistance plan that can be presented to the Syrian authorities.\\n\\nSince 2017, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has been laying the foundations for a comprehensive Syrian missing persons program that can be scaled up quickly. ICMP has already collected data from almost 80,000 relatives who have reported almost 30,000 missing persons. Data, including genetic reference samples, has been collected from the Syrian Diaspora and from those areas of Syria that were not under the control of the Assad Regime. The opportunity now exists to extend this program across the country.\\n\\nThe creation of the UN’s Independent Institution on Missing Persons (IIMP) is an important step forward. The IIMP can, among other measures, support the efforts of Syrian civil society. The engagement of civil society, including a recognized and active role for families of the missing, has the capacity to bridge political differences and must be based on finding all missing persons and securing the rights of all families, regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation, gender, or role in the conflict.\\n\\nStates hosting Syrian refugees should be encouraged to support CSOs working in the Syrian Diaspora, and support should be given to Syrian human rights groups and first responders already operating inside Syria.\\n\\nLonger-term, it will be necessary to create a domestic Law on Missing Persons; it will also be necessary to establish an inter-ministerial Commission on Missing persons, and to create a Syrian Central Record on missing persons.\\n\\nICMP speaks from experience: it has worked in more than 40 countries, most notably in the Western Balkans, where more than 75 percent of the 40,000 missing persons from the conflicts of the 1990s have been accounted for, including more than 90 percent of the 8,000 men and boys massacred in the Srebrenica Genocide of 1995.', original_date='2024-12-24T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Over the past 13 years, the ICRC has submitted written requests to Syrian authorities and other parties to the conflict, including armed groups, to access detention facilities to conduct humanitarian activities.\\n    \\n    Regarding places of detention under the responsibility of the former Government of Syria, the ICRC has made continuous and determined efforts to gain access to all individuals deprived of their freedom, including those detained by security and military forces as well as those held by armed groups.\\n    \\n    Although the ICRC was granted access to detention facilities under the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (responsible for juvenile centers), it was denied access to other facilities—such as Sednaya Prison and facilities managed by other ministries and security apparatuses. Despite repeated and persistent requests at all levels, the former Syrian authorities did not grant broader access. The last written request, submitted in November 2024, focused specifically on security detainees.\\n    \\n    In conclusion, while the ICRC was the only international organization granted access to detention facilities in Syria over the last 13 years, this access was far from sufficient, given the significant number of detainees the organization was unable to reach.\\n- ## Over the years, several reports have been published about prison conditions in Syria. What has the ICRC done to improve these conditions?\\n    \\n    Since 2011, the ICRC has consistently worked to improve detention conditions for individuals in facilities to which it had access. Over 13 years, ICRC delegates conducted **268 visits** to facilities under the authority of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, including regular visits to central prisons and juvenile centers. These visits adhered to the ICRC’s globally recognized working procedures for detainee visits.\\n    \\n    During this time, the ICRC was able to **visit over 30,000 detainees in these facilities**. Detainees benefited from essential supplies provided by the ICRC, including hygiene items, clothing, and other necessities to ease their confinement. In several prisons, the ICRC improved living conditions for **more than 22,500 detainees** by upgrading water points, family waiting areas, and ventilation systems, and by donating tools and spare parts for facility maintenance.\\n    \\n    Additionally, the ICRC equipped prison clinics, supplied medical materials, and trained medical staff to improve detainees’ access to healthcare. Family-links services facilitated phone calls and exchanges of oral and written messages, reconnecting nearly 28,724 detainees with their families.\\n- ## What has the ICRC done to address allegations of torture in Syrian prisons?\\n    \\n    The ICRC’s position on torture is unequivocal: torture and all forms of cruel, inhumane, degrading, or humiliating treatment are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL). This prohibition is derived from the Geneva Conventions of 1949, their Additional Protocols of 1977, Customary International Humanitarian Law, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984, among other instruments.\\n    \\n    The ICRC takes allegations of torture very seriously, following up on them directly with the concerned authorities and the individuals involved. However, the ICRC does not share its findings publicly, whether regarding general observations or specific cases. The organization engages in confidential, bilateral dialogue with relevant authorities, a method it applies in Syria and the rest of the world.\\n- ## Why hasn’t the ICRC spoken out about prison conditions in Syria?\\n    \\n    The ICRC seeks to maintain or expand access to affected communities, including detainees, by building trust through confidential dialogues with all parties involved in armed conflicts or other situations of violence.\\n    \\n    Confidentiality allows the ICRC to maintain dialogue with all sides, enabling access to detainees and helping them directly.\\n    \\n    However, confidentiality does not equate to complacency or silence. Any decision to publicly address issues must carefully weigh the risks, including the possibility of losing access to detainees and being unable to provide critical protection and assistance to communities caught up in conflict and violence.\\n    \\n    From 2011 to 2024, the ICRC made continuous efforts to expand its access to detention facilities in Syria. Throughout this period, the ICRC delegation in Damascus and senior ICRC leaders, who regularly visited Syria, engaged in dialogue with the former Syrian authorities at all levels to broaden access to detention facilities. Guided by its humanitarian mandate under the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC has also consistently sought the support of states capable of influencing the former Syrian authorities for expanded access. Over the past 13 years, ICRC delegates conducted **268 visits to detention centers** under the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, **visiting over 30,610 detainees**.\\n- ## What does the ICRC’s work in detention facilities involve?\\n    \\n    For over 140 years, the ICRC has been visiting detainees to monitor their conditions of detention. Initially focused on those held in connection with armed conflicts and other situations of violence, the ICRC’s work has expanded to include various categories of detainees.\\n    \\n    The ICRC’s objectives are to:\\n    \\n    \\n    - Prevent forced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and ill-treatment.\\n    - Ensure detainees’ dignity and well-being are respected.\\n    - Promote conditions of detention that align with laws and internationally recognized standards.\\n    \\n    By engaging with authorities, the ICRC addresses the causes and consequences of problems affecting detainees, aiming to make a tangible difference in their lives.\\n- ## With the circumstances in Syria now changed, is the ICRC still conducting prison visits? Has the ICRC been granted access to all places of detention?\\n    \\n    The ICRC will continue to extend its services to authorities in Syria and other parties, offering to visit detainees under their responsibility. It also remains active in visiting places of detention under the authority of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria and has established [**hotlines**](https://www.icrc.org/en/article/syria-icrc-helping-families-find-answers-search-missing) to support former detainees and their families.\\n    \\n    ICRC visits contribute to ensuring humane treatment and conditions, not only through direct assistance but also by providing guidance and advice on the proper and adapted management of detention facilities. Given the current circumstances, the ICRC expects to be granted access to all places of detention in Syria and to conduct its visits according to its globally recognized methods.\\n    \\n    The ICRC also highlights growing concerns about preserving vital records held by state institutions as prisons open and detainees are released. This includes safeguarding potential grave sites and critical documentation such as arrest logs, detainee lists, hospital and court records, and other materials that could clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons.\\n    \\n    To prevent the destruction of these crucial records, the ICRC has called on all relevant parties across Syria to protect them. It has also offered its services to authorities to help preserve both material and digital records and safeguard gravesites.\\n    \\n    Furthermore, the ICRC expects the competent authorities of the caretaker government to ensure that any new detention policies explicitly prevent and end incommunicado detention. Newly detained individuals must have the right to inform their families of their whereabouts and be afforded judicial guarantees that preserve their rights and dignity. Families must also be informed of detention locations and allowed to conduct visits in line with recognized standards and legislation.', original_date='2024-12-23T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Coming after the agreement of Syria’s caretaker authorities, it is the first time the IIIM is authorized to enter Syria and can discuss justice and accountability with Syrian officials. A significant milestone, coinciding with the exact date of the Mechanism’s creation eight years ago in 2016.\\n\\nMr. Petit’s trip is a critical step in advancing the IIIM’s efforts to preserve the evidence of international crimes committed in Syria and to ensure accountability for those responsible.\\n\\n“Our ongoing work is to safeguard evidence and support justice processes for the countless victims impacted over the past 14 years,” said Mr. Petit. “The fall of the Assad rule is a significant opportunity for us to fulfill our mandate on the ground.”\\n\\nAfter meeting with representatives of the caretaker authorities, the IIIM Head accessed a site of significant interest. “Even at one facility, the mountains of government documentation reveal the chilling efficiency of systemizing the regime’s atrocity crimes,” Mr. Petit remarked.\\n\\nMr. Petit highlighted the urgency of preserving the evidence before it is lost forever.\\n\\n“Time is running out,” he stated. “There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold. Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.”\\n\\nDuring his visit, Mr. Petit met with a number of Syrians impacted by the crimes committed during the past decade, including those who have recently returned to the country after years of exile. Their testimonies underscored a widespread demand for truth, justice and inclusion.\\n\\n“Meeting with those who have suffered loss and exile was another sobering reminder of the human cost of this conflict,” said Mr. Petit. “They are asking: Where is the international community? They demand accountability. They want answers about their loved ones, and justice for the crimes committed against them.”\\n\\n“I was deeply moved by the resilience of the Syrians I met in Damascus, who endured years of unfathomable inhumanity. Men and women from all walks of life are demanding that their voices be heard and that the truth of what they have experienced is brought to light. This is something we are fully committed to at the IIIM, ensuring that our work in support to jurisdictions is centered on Syrian victims and survivors.”\\n\\nMr. Petit further emphasized that achieving accountability will require cooperation and coordination among a wide range of actors.\\n\\n“No single entity can address this challenge on its own,” Mr. Petit noted. “It will take a collective and concerted effort. Syrians, civil society organizations, and international partners leveraging their complementary mandates. As a priority all of us must work to preserve evidence of the crimes committed, avoid duplication, and ensure that all victims are inclusively represented in the pursuit of justice.” He added, “The IIIM was specifically created to assist this effort and is ready to play its part in full. The time to act is now.”\\n\\n**About the IIIM**\\n\\nThe International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) is a United Nations organisation, established in 2016 by the UN General Assembly in a landmark vote. It is mandated to assist in the investigation and prosecution of individuals responsible for committing the most serious international crimes (including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide) in Syria since March 2011.\\n\\nThe IIIM works to collect and preserve evidence from multiple sources to support current and potential future accountability proceedings. A significant number of its sources and information providers are Syrian civil society actors.\\n\\nThe IIIM’s work can be used by jurisdictions with the legal authority to prosecute international crimes, thereby supporting accountability for atrocities committed during the Syrian conflict.\\n\\nIt shares information, evidence and analytical products either in response to requests for assistance or proactively with competent jurisdictions.\\n\\nIt integrates a victim survivor centred approach and proactive strategies on gender and children/youth throughout its work, holding regular consultations and engagements with Syrian civil society and victim/survivor communities.\\n\\nIt is not a court or tribunal; it cannot issue indictments or conduct trials and does not have prosecutorial powers.\\n\\nThe IIIM is:\\n\\n- **Independent**: Works without external instructions or influences. It does not share details of the justice processes it supports publicly except as authorised by competent jurisdictions.\\n- **Impartial**: Works to cover all international crimes committed by all parties in the conflict, no matter the affiliation, without bias.\\n- **Rigorous**: Applies international criminal law methodologies throughout all tracks of its work.\\n\\nSince the start of its operations the IIIM maintained its efforts to initiate cooperation from the Syrian Arab Republic, in line with its commitment to impartial and inclusive justice. Its calls went unanswered until December 2024, when it was invited to access Syria for the first time. 48 hours later the IIIM Head led a small delegation to Damascus.', original_date='2024-12-22T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Evidence of crimes left behind will be essential to establish the fate and whereabouts of the tens of thousands of Syrians who have been forcibly disappeared by the former government’s notorious security and intelligence apparatus, as well investigating and prosecuting the perpetrators of crimes under international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\n\\n“Every additional minute of inaction heightens the risk that a family may never discover the fate of their missing loved one, and an official responsible for horrific crimes may never be brought to justice,” said Shadi Haroun, ADMSP program manager.\\n\\nResearchers and investigators from the three organizations visited Damascus between December 10 and 20, 2024, including a combined total of 10 detention facilities, the sites of 7 mass graves, and the military court.\\n\\n“After decades of brutal oppression, injustice and impunity Syrians finally have a glimmer of hope for justice,” said Aya Majzoub, deputy regional director for Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. “This is a pivotal moment for Syria’s transitional authorities to act decisively and ensure the preservation of evidence as a cornerstone for accountability and reconciliation.”\\n\\nIn all the detention facilities visited, researchers observed that official documents were often left unprotected, with significant portions looted or destroyed. Residents from the neighborhoods around some of these facilities, former detainees, and members of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) inside those facilities said that in some cases, the security and intelligence personnel burned key information before they fled as the Assad government fell.\\n\\nIn some cases, they said that armed groups who took control of the facilities and detainees who had just been freed burned and looted documents. The researchers also observed ordinary people, including families of missing detainees and some journalists, take some documents.\\n\\nThese documents may contain [vital information](https://syriaaccountability.org/walls-have-ears/) about the structure of the Syrian state’s security and intelligence apparatus, the identity of those responsible for serious crimes, and details about the detainees held in these locations.\\n\\nADMSP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch raised these concerns during a meeting with members of HTS-affiliated Syrian Salvation Government [political affairs department](https://www.facebook.com/syriadpa/?locale=ar_AR) in Damascus on December 16. During the meeting, officials promised to strengthen security around key facilities.\\n\\nAfter urgently securing these locations and ensuring that the remaining evidence is not tampered with, the transitional authorities should coordinate with and immediately give unfettered access to the international fact-finding and evidence collection bodies created by the United Nations. They should include the Independent, Impartial Investigative Mechanism (IIIM), the International Institution for Missing Persons (IIMP), and the Commission of Inquiry on Syria (CoI) as well as Syrian civil society organizations with experience in analyzing such evidence.\\n\\nThe Investigative Mechanism should act swiftly to secure evidence, including by establishing a formal agreement with transitional authorities to operate legally and transparently in Syria. It needs to prioritize the immediate preservation documentation and securing of mass grave sites, archives and other critical evidence. Similarly, the Missing Person’s Institution could step into a coordinating role to unify fragmented efforts by Syrian and international civil society groups to secure evidence that could provide answers as to the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared.\\n\\nBy leading a collaborative and systematic evidence preservation process, both bodies can ensure critical documentation is safeguarded, laying the groundwork for accountability and justice. Governments should support efforts to secure and safeguard evidence, including by providing necessary resources and funding.\\n\\nDuring the meeting with transitional authorities, the organizations also underscored the importance of securing mass grave sites across the country. Researchers visited the sites of four mass graves on the outskirts of Damascus and shared the coordinates of those sites with the relevant authorities. In all four sites, researchers observed local residents and families of the disappeared try to dig up some of the remains. In one mass grave site, researchers saw local residents dig up a leg that still had flesh on it, indicating that it had been buried recently.\\n\\nIn 2017, an Amnesty International report [documenting mass hangings and extermination](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/5415/2017/en/) at [Seydnaya prison](https://saydnaya.amnesty.org/) [found](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MDE2454152017ENGLISH.pdf) that that the bodies of detainees executed or who died from torture and inhumane conditions of detention in that prison were buried in mass graves, including at one of the locations researchers visited in December 2024. Under the former government, authorities rarely returned remains of victims to family members and rarely informed them of their loved one’s death.\\n\\nThe government of ousted President Bashar al-Assad used extrajudicial executions in conjunction with other unlawful tactics, such as arbitrary arrests, deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, and starvation of the civilian population, to forcibly displace residents of opposition-held areas over the course of the war.\\n\\nExtrajudicial executions and summary killings are serious violations of international human rights law and can amount to crimes against humanity when carried out as part of a systematic or widespread attack against the civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of state or organizational policy to commit such an “attack.” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have [documented](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/03/syria-torture-centers-revealed) the systematic use of [torture](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MDE2454152017ENGLISH.pdf) under the previous government as a crime against humanity.\\n\\nSyria’s transitional authorities should clearly and publicly commit to securing, collecting and safeguarding evidence, including from mass grave sites and government records and archives, that will be vital in giving the families of the over 100,000 disappeared in Syria answers about the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones as well as in future accountability processes and legal proceedings. The International Court of Justice’s binding provisional measures in the torture case against Syria obligates the state to preserve evidence of abuses.\\n\\nThe Syrian transitional authorities should also cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross and other specialized organizations, including from Syrian civil society, that can provide critical expertise and support to safeguard these records with the view to assist in clarifying what happened to missing people and thereby enable families, left in excruciating uncertainty for years, if not decades, to obtain answers. Public awareness campaigns can explain the significance of evidence preservation, the steps being taken, and how communities can engage in this process without inadvertently hampering it.\\n\\n“The families of Syria’s tens of thousands of forcibly disappeared deserve an end to their torment,” said [Hiba Zayadin](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/hiba-zayadin), senior Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Many of the answers to what happened to their loved ones are likely to be found in ransacked offices, looted documents or disturbed mass grave sites. It is vital for Syrians to hear directly from transitional leaders about their dedication and commitment to uncovering the truth and delivering answers to the families of the disappeared.”\\n\\nTo ensure accountability and build trust in their governance, transitional authorities should also put a stop to reprisal killings, making clear that such crimes will not be tolerated. They should address concerns about arbitrary detention in areas under their control. This includes providing independent monitors access to HTS-controlled detention centers, and ensuring every detainee is under judicial supervision. Transparency in how detainees are treated and held is essential to demonstrate a clear break from past patterns of repression by all parties to the conflict in Syria, and to signal to Syrians that the cycle of arbitrary detention and abuse will not be repeated.', original_date='2024-12-23T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

This project, aimed at preparing for the upcoming planting season, follows the earlier distribution of fertilizers.\\n\\nThe seeds, comprising premium Syrian varieties such as Douma-1, Cham-11, and Bohouth-9, were distributed to 2,000 farmers, with each farmer receiving 500 kilograms — enough to cultivate two hectares of land. Additionally, each farmer was provided with 400 kilograms of fertilizer to support crop growth. This initiative aims to significantly enhance wheat production, strengthen food security, and build resilience across the region.\\n\\nAmong its beneficiaries are 208 women landowners who previously lacked the resources to plant their lands. Ilham, one of these women, shared her story:\\n\\n***\"When I lost my husband, I felt like I had lost my support and everything in life. But when I look at my daughters, I know I must be strong for them, for they are a trust in my care. When I received the seeds and fertilizer, it felt as though hope had returned to our lives. This land, which was once barren, has today become a symbol of hope and hard work, and I cultivate it out of love for my children and their future.\"***\\n\\nZakiah, another recipient, expressed her deep gratitude and determination, emphasizing how the support has transformed her life: ***\"When I started cultivating the land, I felt like I was planting hope back into my life. This land is my only refuge, and the support I received gave me the confidence that I can face all challenges on my own.\"*** She proudly added: ***\"What I plant today will not only feed me but will also give me the strength to stand on my feet and support myself. I feel like I represent all women, and I want to be an example for them, showing that work and determination are the path to achieving security and stability.\"***\\n\\nThis EUR 2.76 million project directly benefits 2,000 farm owners and approximately 10,000 family members. Furthermore, it is expected to indirectly benefit 90,000 individuals per month by increasing the availability of wheat and improving access to bread.\\n\\nThe initiative is a critical step in empowering farmers, particularly women, and strengthening livelihoods across targeted areas. By supporting sustainable agricultural growth, the project contributes to the recovery and resilience of communities impacted by years of hardship, delivering hope for a brighter future.\\n\\n**For more information about this project, please visit:**\\n\\n[**Support Farmers for Wheat Crop Production in North Aleppo - Phase III**](https://www.srtfund.org/projects/823-support-farmers-for-wheat-crop-production-in-north-aleppo-phase-iii)\\n\\n**For more information on the SRTF visit:**\\n\\n[http://www.srtfund.org](http://www.srtfund.org/)\\n\\n**Media outlets may contact:**\\n\\ncommunications@srtfund.org', original_date='2024-12-22T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The situation worsened following the regime's fall on December 1, 2024, resulting from the opposition's “Deterrence of Aggression” operation launched on November 27, 2024. To identify critical needs and intervention priorities, a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) was conducted across Aleppo City neighborhoods. The assessment included 202 household interviews and consultations with 17 diverse key informants (KIl).\\n\\nThe findings highlighted the urgent need for immediate, multisectoral interventions to address the deteriorating conditions and support the city’s recovery efforts.\\n\\n- Food Security and Nutrition: Severe food shortages were reported by 88% of respondents, with 49% of males and 39% of females headed households affected. The primary need identified was food assistance for their households. Additionally, 96% of respondents indicated that their main source of food was purchasing from markets, with 51% of male-headed and 45% of female-headed households relying on this method. 63% of respondents highlighted cash support is needed to purchase food items from markets.\\n- Winterization: Due to harsh weather conditions and damaged shelters during the conflict, 54% of surveyed individuals reported a need for winterization support, including high-thermal blankets, plastic sheets, and other essential winter items.\\n- Access to basic services: Access to electricity and fuel for power generation was reported by 49% of respondents as a critical need. Additionally, 21% cited a need for access to clean drinking water, while 13% highlighted the need for water for cleaning and bathing purposes.  \\n     Notably, 91% of respondents reported no presence of I/NGO activities in their area.\\n- Safety and Security: The primary concerns reported by respondents included theft 45%, revenge 11%, and unexploded ordnance 10%. Notably, many people remained fearful of returning to, or living in, destroyed communities due to ongoing instability and insufficient resources after the regime's fall.\\n- Shelter and NFI: Among surveyed households, 19% identified non-food items (NFls), 7% requested hygiene supplies, and 2% expressed a need for urgent shelter rehabilitation.  \\n     Regarding living arrangements, 42% of households are settled in rented accommodation, 36% reside in their own homes, 12% are hosted by others, and 9% live in unfinished buildings.

It is now grappling with unstable security, an escalating humanitarian crisis, and widespread displacement. Amid this uncertainty, the situation in Syria remains fluid, with considerable impacts on the population. Airstrikes have been reported in southern Syria, as well as in Homs, Tartous, and Lattakia, resulting in damage to residential homes, health facilities, a bridge in Homs, a port in Lattakia, and a main water pipeline in Alhamediya town, Quneitra governorate. Hostilities have also been reported in Aleppo and Deir-ez-Zor, where the Hatla bridge was damaged, and several routes were cut off. These attacks have exacerbated the humanitarian situation in affected areas. In northeast Syria (NES), insecurity remains a concern, particularly in Al-Hasakeh and Ar-Raqqa governorates, where a curfew was imposed in most areas on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. While the road between Qamishli city and Ar-Raqqa governorate has reopened for civilian traffic, airports remain closed.\\n\\n**Population movements**\\n\\nReturns of internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been dynamic. As of 15 December, a total of 225,000 IDP returnees have been recorded, primarily in Hama and Aleppo governorates. This has led to a decrease in the number of IDPs, from 1.1 million on 12 December to 882,000 by 15 December. Among the newly displaced, at least 150,000 have been displaced multiple times.\\n\\nThere are growing concerns in Ain Al-Arab (Aleppo governorate) about a potential displacement wave in case of escalation at the border. If the security situation deteriorates, it is expected that people will relocate to Sarin and Ar- Raqqa city. As of 16 December, 250 sites, including municipal buildings, schools, mosques, stadiums, and residential buildings, are being used as reception centres to shelter displaced people across NES areas. Since 4 December, over 44,000 individuals have been displaced to NES due to fighting in Tall Refaat and Aleppo and are living in collective shelters.\\n\\nDisplacement continues in the southern governorates, especially in Quneitra and Dar'a, where the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting operations and urging populations in several border towns to evacuate. In some villages, up to 40 per cent of the population has fled, likely seeking refuge with relatives or friends within the same governorate.\\n\\nThe Government of Lebanon reports fewer than 10,000 Syrians have returned from Lebanon since 8 December, with daily movements through both official and unofficial border crossings. Many of these returns appear to be temporary, primarily for checking on property or family members. Both Syrians and Lebanese continue to cross into Lebanon daily via official and unofficial border points, with Arida, Qaa, and Masnaa border crossings open to the public. This includes Lebanese who had been residing in Syria or had sought refuge there during the hostilities in Lebanon. Syrians who meet specific entry criteria, such as holding residency permits or onward tickets for transit through Beirut, are allowed (re-) entry through official border points. Since 8 December, approximately 90,000 people, including 20,000 Lebanese, have arrived in Lebanon, with local authorities providing temporary shelter for those in need.\\n\\nAt the Türkiye-Syria border, the main return processing points at Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salama remain calm, with relatively low numbers of returns before 8 December. However, in the last five days, daily returns have increased to between 1,300 and 1,850, with over 7,600 individuals returning between 9 and 13 December.\\n\\nThe situation at the Jordanian border is similarly quiet, with lower-than-usual traffic. The Al-Qaim border crossing in Federal Iraq remains fully closed for both entry and exit.\", original_date='2024-12-21T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The escalation resulted in mass displacement, destruction of critical infrastructure, and significant humanitarian needs.\\n\\nOver 1.1 million people have been displaced, with the potential for up to 1.5 million more if the violence continues. Many families are seeking shelter in overcrowded and underserved areas, and reports indicate significant civilian casualties, injuries, and shortages of food. Access to healthcare, protection, livelihoods, and basic services has been severely restricted due to ongoing hostilities and insecurity.\\n\\nThere are multiple overlapping population movements in this crisis too, including major internal displacement within Syria, some IDPs returning home, movements out of Syria and steadily increasing numbers of refugee returns, which stand at a few tens of thousands at the time of writing.\\n\\nWhile families are attempting to return to areas perceived as safer, many are confronted with destroyed infrastructure, limited services, economic collapse, and insecurity, including unexploded ordnance, contamination, and general criminality. Sustainable reintegration and long-term assistance are crucial in this environment. SARC volunteers and branches are on the ground providing food assistance, clean water, medical evacuation, Restoring Family Links (RFL), dead body management, and Mental Health & Psychosocial Support (MHPSS), among others.\\n\\nSARC has long experience in delivering humanitarian aid through overlapping multiple crises over the last 13 years, encompassing complex protracted conflict, population movements, COVID-19, cholera, the 2023 earthquake, seasonal floods, droughts, and wildfires. And with the situation in Syria highly volatile, with ongoing military operations, potential spillover and significant population movement across borders may impact neighbouring countries as well, leading to yet further immediate and long-term humanitarian needs.\\n\\n### IFRC approach\\n\\nResponding to this fast-moving context requires an agile, flexible, and coordinated Red Cross Red Crescent Movement-wide approach both in Syria and in neighbouring countries. The IFRC will work to ensure that this response uses a “one-country” approach while addressing the unique needs of specific regions, and addressing sudden changes in context as they emerge with possible new humanitarian implications affecting both Syria and neighbouring countries.

It was dismayed to see that much evidence and documentation that could assist families to discover the whereabouts of disappeared loved ones and serve as evidence in future accountability processes had been damaged, taken or destroyed.\\n\\nIn some cases, large storehouses of documents had been set on fire and burned. Families at some of these sites were combing through whatever documentation remained, in the hope of finding any clues as to the fate of their loved ones.\\n\\nThe team also observed large number of documents that were still salvageable, and received information that additional records have been safeguarded in other locations, either in situ by the caretaker government or elsewhere by civil society organizations.\\n\\nThe team also learned exhumation of mass graves has already begun, both by rescue organisations and by private individuals.\\n\\nThe Commission warned that actions taken now, even if well-intentioned, may complicate future efforts to identify the people who were lost and bring closure to their families. Utmost care must be taken to protect mass grave sites and to safeguard all documents and evidence across Syria.\\n\\nTo help in this, the Commission suggested that the new government establish a unit to lead and coordinate the protection and preservation of mass grave sites as well as all relevant documentation, until such time as Syrian and international experts can examine them and forensically exhume bodies and remains, to protect families’ right to truth.\\n\\nMany several national and international human rights and humanitarian entities have offered to aid in this endeavour, to protect documents and locations pertaining to potential crimes - both for future accountability processes as well as for the humanitarian imperative of locating the missing and supporting their families.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Commission suggested that the government issue appropriate proclamations at the highest level through public communications channels requiring the public to refrain from disturbing such sites and that any documents or evidence taken be returned, while communicating that this will facilitate the justice and accountability processes to follow in the months and years ahead.\\n\\nAt this critical juncture in Syria’s history, and at a time of great expectations by the Syrian people, the Commission reiterate its full solidarity with the entire Syrian people, and stands ready to support in any capacity it can.\\n\\nENDS\\n\\n**Background**: The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established on 22 August 2011 by the Human Rights Council through resolution [**S-17/1**](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/ResS17_1.pdf).The mandate of the Commission is to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in the Syrian Arab Republic.

They urged the release of all persons arbitrarily detained across the country and called for safeguarding all evidence of gross human rights and international humanitarian law violations.\\n\\n“Justice should be pursued for all crimes committed, regardless of the perpetrator, through a credible judicial system focused on accountability, reparations, reconciliation and not revenge. It is vital that such processes conform fully with international human rights standards and remain free from any form of revanchism. The involvement of civil society and human rights defenders in a just transition is crucially important for the process to be credible,” the experts said.\\n\\nSyria has endured major foreign interventions, transforming the country into the site of an extensive proxy war, involving also private actors. The continuing military interventions, like the recent unprovoked, illegal attacks by Israel, its occupation of more Syrian territory in the Golan Heights and other air-attacks and incursions into north-east and central Syria, put grave obstacles to the rehabilitation process and destabilize the region.\\n\\n“While international support and cooperation for Syria’s rebuilding is essential, the rehabilitation process must remain free of foreign interference or aggression” the experts said. “The political transition must be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned.

Elle a dénoncé la présence illégale de forces israéliennes dans la zone de séparation, qui constitue une violation flagrante de l’Accord sur le dégagement de 1974.\\n\\nEn outre, les attaques israéliennes visant des cibles à la fois civiles et militaires, tout comme les incursions dans le territoire syrien et l’occupation de nouveaux territoires, sont des violations flagrantes de l’Accord ainsi que des résolutions pertinentes du Conseil, a poursuivi la délégation. L’Algérie a enfin condamné la répression violente exercée aujourd’hui même par des soldats israéliens contre des manifestants syriens qui protestaient contre leur présence dans leur pays.

activités de liaison menées par la FNUOD pour prévenir toute escalade de la situation au-delà de la ligne de cessez-le-feu,\\n\\n*Alarmé* par le fait que la violence en République arabe syrienne risque de gravement envenimer le conflit qui touche la région,\\n\\n*Se déclarant préoccupé* par toutes les violations de l’Accord sur le dégagement des forces,\\n\\n*Prenant note* du dernier rapport en date du Secrétaire général sur la situation dans la zone d’opérations de la FNUOD, y compris les conclusions relatives aux tirs de part et d’autre de la ligne de cessez-le-feu ainsi que la

possible,\\n\\n*Soulignant* qu’il importe que les pays fournisseurs de contingents et lui-même puissent prendre connaissance des rapports et des informations concernant la configuration de la FNUOD à la suite de son redéploiement, et insistant à nouveau sur le fait que de telles informations lui sont utiles pour évaluer l’action de la Force et adapter ou revoir son mandat, et pour tenir des consultations éclairées avec les pays fournisseurs de contingents,\\n\\n*Soulignant* que la FNUOD doit pouvoir disposer de tous les moyens et ressources dont elle a besoin pour s’acquitter de son mandat en toute sécurité, notamment des moyens technologiques et de l’équipement voulus pour mieux observer la zone de séparation et la ligne de cessez-le-feu et, au besoin, pour améliorer sa propre

inacceptables,\\n\\n*Exprimant* sa profonde gratitude au personnel militaire et civil de la FNUOD, notamment à celui du Groupe d’observateurs au Golan, pour leur travail dans des conditions toujours

améliorer le fonctionnement des missions, notamment les décisions portant sur le déploiement, la remédiation, le rapatriement et les mesures incitatives, et *déclare* de nouveau être favorable à

Her appointment comes after nearly a year and a half of work by colleagues at the UN Human Rights Office supporting the launch of this important institution.\\n\\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk has flagged how important this moment is in Syria - both for those who are still missing, and for their loved ones. Since the fall of former president Bashar Al-Assad’s government, almost two weeks ago, we have seen footage of hundreds of detainees pouring out of now open prisons – some expressing happiness to see sunlight, but others so shocked after years of torture and inhumane treatment that they are incapable of any form of expression.\\n\\nMany of them had been detained incommunicado for years, leaving their families without any information on their fate or whereabouts. We have seen the touching scenes of people hugging each other for the first time in years, others struggling to recognise their sons and daughters, and many families who have remained in distress as they haven’t found their loved ones yet.\\n\\nThey deserve to have all the answers about their relatives’ fate and whereabouts, and to know the circumstances in which they went missing. They also need mental health and psychosocial support.

Led by Mr. Peter Rademaker, Regional Deputy Director of the ILO Regional Office for the Arab States, and Mr. José Manuel Medina Checa, Senior Specialist for Employers’ Activities, the visit aimed to strengthen ties with Syrian employers’ organizations and explore avenues for cooperation in the country’s rebuilding efforts. After a 13-year civil war, Syria is entering a challenging transition period. Over 90% of the population lives below the poverty line, millions remain displaced, and critical infrastructure such as housing, hospitals, and transportation networks has been severely damaged. The private sector has faced immense hardships, with factories destroyed, supply chains disrupted, and a significant loss of skilled workers and entrepreneurs due to the conflict.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, organizations such as the Chambers of Industry in Aleppo and Damascus have continued to support their members, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) playing a crucial role in sustaining local economies. However, the situation remains precarious, necessitating urgent reforms and international support.

Addressing the sexual violence that has marred the country’s history is critical not just for the survivors but for future generations. This is a necessary foundation for durable peace and reconciliation”, added Special Representative Patten.\\n\\nSpecial Representative Patten further calls on the caretaker Government to adopt a robust survivor-centered framework that ensures counseling, mental health services and medical care tailored to the unique needs of survivors of sexual violence, given that the psychological wounds are deep and enduring. She further urges the caretaker Government to prioritize a legal framework that holds perpetrators of these crimes accountable. “For too long, survivors have been denied effective avenues to seek redress and accountability. Justice must not be a distant dream; it is an urgent necessity”, she added.\\n\\nSpecial Representative Patten reiterated the Secretary-General’s call for the protection of the rights of all Syrians without any distinction. She further called on all parties in Syria to take steps to prevent any further instances of sexual violence, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions, including 1888 (2009), 2106 (2013) and 2467 (2019).\\n\\nSexual violence is one of the most heinous crimes committed during the Syrian conflict. “In honoring the dignity and resilience of survivors, the caretaker Government must ensure that they are at the forefront of Syria’s reconstruction. Their voices, as well as those of civil society groups, too long silenced by fear, must be heard. Transitional justice mechanisms must address the needs of victims/survivors, including survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, as a matter of priority. These justice measures include the immediate preservation of evidence for future criminal proceedings in accordance with due process of law and support to rule of law institutions,” stated Special Representative Patten.\\n\\nSpecial Representative Patten further calls for a durable solution for Syrian and foreign nationals arbitrarily detained in al-Hol and al-Roj camps and other facilities in Northeast Syria, the majority of whom are women and children, many of whom are survivors of forced marriage, sexual slavery, trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and other forms of sexual violence and may remain at risk.\\n\\n“Addressing the legacy of sexual violence in Syria is not solely a national obligation but an international imperative”, Special Representative Patten underscored, calling on the international donor and diplomatic community to provide financial and technical support to amplify survivors’ voices, meet their needs and safeguard their rights.\\n\\nThe Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict will continue to closely monitor events in Syria and the region and stands ready to work with the caretaker Government and all relevant partners, to foster inclusive and durable peace, with safe access to services and justice for all survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, including through the engagement of the UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict Network and the rapid deployment of the United Nations Team of Experts on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict.\\n\\n***For media inquiries, please contact:***\\n\\n***Ms. Géraldine Boezio, Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict***\\n\\n***Tel: +1 917 367 3306 Email:*** geraldine.boezio@un.org\\n\\n***Follow us on social media: @endrapeinwar***', original_date='2024-12-20T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The threat of a military operation in Kobani raises concerns about further instability in the area, and potential displacement if the operation proceeds. Throughout the past week, fragile ceasefire agreements have failed repeatedly to hold, although a full-scale operation has not yet been launched in this area.\\n\\nAs of 17 December, a total of 263 sites including municipal buildings, schools, mosques, stadiums, and residential buildings are being utilized as reception sites and Emergency Collective Centers (ECCs) to accommodate people throughout all areas of Northeast Syria (NES). These sites are currently hosting 44,395 individuals.

The resilience of the Syrian people is on full display, as is their hope for the future. Over the past 12 days or so, I’ve witnessed both the joy of reunions and returns, as well as the concerns about the uncertainty of what lies ahead.\\n\\nIn the midst of these challenges, WHO remains steadfast—not just in delivering life-saving aid and ensuring healthcare reaches those who need it most, but also in helping Syrians rebuild their lives and recover from years of crisis.\\n\\nJust yesterday, WHO teams were in Idlib, visiting hospitals that have become lifelines during the recent escalation of conflict. They met with dedicated surgeons who have worked tirelessly, often under attack, to save lives. One surgeon shared with us the words of a patient who walked through their doors: “We finally sleep at night, no longer worrying about being bombarded.”\\n\\nOur team also met Ahmed, a 64-year-old man who relies on kidney dialysis. Over the past decade, he has been displaced multiple times and has faced enormous uncertainty to access his treatment. Thanks to Bab Al-Hawa Hospital in Idlib, which is supported by WHO, Ahmed has been able to maintain his care. Yet, the funding for this essential service will run out in three months. Ahmed is deeply hopeful, not just for himself but for all Syrians, dreaming of a future where no one has to endure the uncertainty he has lived through.\\n\\nIt is this fragile hope that keeps them going, even as they endure tremendous hardships—sleeping in tents through the bitter cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer. In these conditions, displaced populations, especially those living in camps or informal settlements, are extremely vulnerable. Overcrowded living conditions, food insecurity, and inadequate sanitation are perfect breeding grounds fr nutritional deficiencies, respiratory infections and other communicable diseases such as diarrheal disease, as well as lice and scabies, which can lead to long-term health complications.\\n\\nMany people the team met in Idlib have returned to visit their homes since December 8th, only to find them reduced to rubble. These individuals, displaced multiple times or having returned from Lebanon and Turkey, need support to rebuild their lives. Rebuilding homes is just one part of the solution; they also need access to healthcare and essential services to feel secure and to lay the foundations for recovery.\\n\\nAnd in a nation reeling from over a decade of conflict and displacement, mental health and psychosocial services are not just critical—they are lifesaving for families. Our team met Fatima whose two daughters, aged 6 and 10 years, have suffered from sleepless nights, recurring nightmares, and anxiety. Over the past three weeks, they have benefited from psychosocial support services, giving them a sense of stability and hope. But this support must continue.\\n\\nThe reality is, even in this historic moment, the humanitarian need remain immense and immediate.\\n\\nSyria is grappling with one of the largest displacement crises in the world, with 7.4 million people internally displaced before this recent escalation. Over 880,000 have been displaced since then. Among them, 6% are individuals with disabilities who face severe barriers to accessing care.\\n\\nThe health infrastructure is severely strained. In just three weeks, 36 attacks on healthcare facilities have been and over half of the country’s hospitals are non-functional.\\n\\nWHO has launched an appeal to raise $56.4 million to meet these urgent needs over the next six months. This funding will sustain critical health services during this transitional period – including 141 health facilities in northwest Syria at risk of closure in the coming weeks – and support Syria’s long road to recovery.\\n\\nWHO is doing everything possible to bridge this gap. Our teams are:\\n\\n- Facilitating access to healthcare for displaced populations and returnees through referrals to functional facilities and mobile clinics providing basic care, vaccinations, and maternal health services.\\n- Integrating mental health support into healthcare facilities, particularly for those affected by trauma.\\n- Coordinating referrals between non-functional and operational health facilities and ensuring the safe transportation of patients to specialized hospitals for critical care.\\n\\nBut we cannot do this alone.\\n\\n- The resilience of the Syrian people is inspiring, but without immediate international support, their hopes for a peaceful and healthy future are at risk.\\n- Everyone my team and I speak to here is hopeful—hopeful for their children, for their homes, and a Syria rebuilt on peace and solidarity. We must help them realize this dream.\\n- We call on the international community to act now—your swift action can save lives, restore hope, and help rebuild a nation yearning for stability and peace.\\n\\nThank you.', original_date='2024-12-20T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='Responding to Syria at a Time of Need; Statement by IOM Chief', body='***Statement delivered by IOM Director General Amy Pope at the United Nations Media Briefing in Geneva***\\n\\nI have just returned from Damascus, where the impact of nearly 14 years of conflict is evident everywhere. I went in as one of the first UN principals on the ground, and we met with the caretaker government, humanitarian, civil society, diplomatic and donor communities.  \\n I saw a country at a junction—its people resolute, determined to move on from the past, determined to rebuild their lives, though wary of the immense uncertainty of what lies ahead.\\n\\nThe numbers tell a staggering story. Even before the latest developments, over 16 million Syrians needed humanitarian assistance, more than six million have left the country, and 7.2 million remained displaced within its borders.\\n\\nThe returns that it is estimated will happen are on a much larger scale than we have seen, and integrating those who return in parallel with transitional justice is going to be a truly monumental task.\\n\\nIn some areas of the country, essential infrastructure, from hospitals to schools, has been destroyed or is dysfunctional. Aleppo, for instance, was all but destroyed during the conflict between 2012 and 2016, with over two million people leaving the city.\\n\\nHumanitarian needs range from the most basic—shelter, food, and clean water—to the complex task of rebuilding a shattered society.\\n\\nAnd while there is a strong desire among displaced Syrians to return to their homes, doing so prematurely could overwhelm already fragile infrastructure, potentially forcing families to move again. I met with Syrians in Lebanon, and understood their uncertainty about what lies ahead.\\n\\nI traveled as part of a delegation led by the ERC, which met with several representatives of the caretaker government. I met with a representative of the caretaker government working on social affairs who would be our primary government partner in our response. He has expressed interest in rebuilding the country and openness to the international community with a stated willingness to partner to address the needs of Syrians.\\n\\nHistorically, we were pushed out of the country by the previous government. We continued providing aid through a cross-border program, reaching millions since 2014. In Northwest Syria, where we have our larger hub presently, this is now a vital lifeline for those displaced by the escalation of conflict in Idleb and northern Aleppo. Due to increased levels of displacement in that part of Syria, this operation urgently needs more resources, and IOM has launched an appeal to address the urgent, lifesaving needs here.\\n\\nIOM has also played a key role in the health sector in Syria, in cooperation with the Global Fund and WHO. IOM facilitated the establishment of medical oxygen plants in several hospitals throughout the country.\\n\\nWe need to address needs more widely however, and now is the time for the international community to pull together. The need to establish an inclusive society embracing religious minorities, women and diverse political groups must be at the front of our thinking when it comes to this support. Let me set out how we can most effectively help the people of Syria rebuild.\\n\\n**The number one priority is humanitarian assistance**. The numbers are stark. More than 90 per cent of the population is living below the poverty line. We have seen 800,000 newly displaced people in recent weeks.\\n\\nThe reality is that up to two weeks ago, for the last 13 years of war, the UN faced incredible challenges to meet these humanitarian needs because of all the barriers put in our way by the Assad regime, preventing the UN from systematically assessing need and delivering assistance. We could not always access locations, get visas, or work effectively.\\n\\nLike the people of Syria, the UN was stuck in this situation for a long time. This is an important opportunity to show that we can scale up and deliver for the Syrian people, particularly the most vulnerable, whose lives have been devastated by this long war and tyrannical regime.\\n\\nThe situation is fragile. The country remains under sanctions. There is a huge shortage of normal goods. Most of the economy relies on cash. The country simply needs all kinds of support from the international community.\\n\\nAs an illustration of the widespread poverty, when I was in Damascus, we met with civil society partners. One was a young female resident doctor, earning just $50 a month at a public hospital. She had to take on other work, just to sustain her existence.\\n\\nExemptions from sanctions for development and reconstruction efforts is critical so that we can start scaling up, but this is a matter for member states to decide.\\n\\n**The second key priority is stabilization.** There will be a transition – justice, reparation and inclusivity is an important part of this. Housing, land and property rights are critical, and at the heart of community stabilization, in the context of anticipated returns. We have experience delivering on this in many countries, such as in neighboring Iraq, where we saw the vital role of protecting and supporting these rights in post-conflict recovery.\\n\\nBy safeguarding fundamental rights, rebuilding trust following years of conflict, and enabling broader programming including shelter, livelihoods, and social cohesion, we addressed immediate recovery needs while promoting a conducive environment for peaceful and durable solutions, sustainable returns, and long-term stability for those affected by conflict and displacement.\\n\\nReturns will follow, however in line with our sister agency UNHCR, for the time being we are not promoting large-scale voluntary returns. Many communities are not ready to absorb the return of both internally displaced and refugees, and all returns must be voluntary, dignified and safe.\\n\\nSyrians want to know that when they go home, they are going home for good, and their families will be safe and supported.\\n\\nThose families have a lot to consider, they need to know that they are making the right decision. They need to know where their children will go to school. They need to know if their home is still there or has been destroyed, or if they are safe. The global landmine clearance charity The Halo estimates that large parts of the region, mainly in the northwest and southwest, are riddled with cluster munitions, missiles, landmines, grenades and other deadly explosive ordinance.\\n\\nIOM is speaking with Syrians communities who say they want to assess the situation. I also spoke to Lebanese authorities at the border who explained that the regular and irregular movement at the border including people from minority groups coming into Lebanon - not because of a direct threat, but rather fear of what could happen to them, due to the current uncertainties.\\n\\nSyrians in neighboring countries are very interested in ‘go-and-see visits’ and an enabling environment that would allow them to do that in a safe and secure way would be very helpful and protective to people who have been subject to hardship for many years now.\\n\\n**So how will we put these steps into action? Firstly, a critical role right now is capturing data**. At the moment everybody from NGOs to UN partners and the diplomatic and donor community recognize the data gap that exists.\\n\\nAt IOM we can fill this gap, resuming an initiative allowing UN and Government partners to understand where the needs are, where to target assistance, which communities to target and the state of the nation. Undertaking this critical groundwork fast is extremely important, because without the data, we cannot know where to prioritize assistance, and so this is central to the entire response.\\n\\nWithout having a picture of all the pieces, we cannot put the humanitarian aid jigsaw together.\\n\\nSecondly, we are scaling up our presence. Since 2018, IOM has not had presence in Damascus due to challenges with the then Syrian government. To put this work into effect, we are reestablishing our presence in Damascus and other areas, so that we have a solid footprint and resume collaborative efforts with all partners and local communities.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, we are in close contact with neighboring countries who have hosted Syrian populations through this time. They are naturally also watchful of the situation and need support in adjusting to the changing landscape. We urge the international community to continue to provide support to those countries who host large numbers of Syrian people.\\n\\nIOM has been deeply involved in several large-scale returns following peace agreements, playing a critical role in facilitating voluntary returns, reintegration, and rebuilding efforts in places like South Sudan, Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Liberia. We know from these situations rebuilding after crisis what the challenges are, and what the urgent priorities will be.\\n\\nToday, IOM reaffirms its commitment to the people of Syria.\\n\\nThe people of Syria have endured unimaginable hardship, yet they continue to show endless courage.\\n\\nLet us match their resilience with our solidarity and honor their hope with our action. And as we mobilize, the world should not underestimate what is required.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\n***The recorded statement is available*** [***here***](https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1ng2u7icb?utm_source=UN+Palais&utm_campaign=ba6b8f3b9c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_12_07_11_32_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_00b5064acf-ba6b8f3b9c-)', original_date='2024-12-20T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Esta posición deja sin efecto y reemplaza las Consideraciones de Protección Internacional del ACNUR con respecto a las personas que huyen de la República Árabe Siria, Actualización VI, de marzo de 20211.  \\nTeniendo en cuenta la inestabilidad de la situación, esta guía será actualizada tan pronto como sea necesario, con base en la rápida evolución de las circunstancias.  \\nRetornos voluntarios\\n\\n2\\\\. Siria se encuentra en una encrucijada: entre la paz y la guerra, la estabilidad y el caos, la reconstrucción o una mayor devastación. Ahora Siria tiene la extraordinaria oportunidad de avanzar hacia la paz y permitir que su población comience a regresar a sus hogares. Durante muchos años, el ACNUR ha insistido en la necesidad de redoblar los esfuerzos para crear condiciones favorables tendientes a que las personas refugiadas y desplazadas retornen a sus hogares, y la situación actual abre nuevas oportunidades en este sentido, las cuales debemos aprovechar todos. Esto incluye la eliminación y/o la gestión de toda nueva barrera de seguridad, jurídica y administrativa por parte de las autoridades de facto sirias; una significativa asistencia humanitaria y de recuperación temprana que los Estados donantes deben proporcionar a las personas retornadas, a las comunidades que las reciben y a las zonas de retorno real y potencial en general; y la autorización al ACNUR y a sus socios con el fin de supervisar los retornos en los cruces fronterizos y en los lugares donde las personas decidan retornar.\\n\\n3\\\\. Toda persona tiene derecho a retornar a su país de origen. El ACNUR está dispuesto a apoyar a las personas refugiadas sirias que, habiendo sido plenamente informadas de la situación en sus lugares de origen o en una zona alternativa de su elección, decidan retornar voluntariamente. Sin embargo, en vista de los numerosos desafíos que enfrenta la población en Siria, incluida una crisis humanitaria a gran escala, niveles elevados y persistentes de desplazamiento interno, y destrucción y daños generalizados de viviendas e infraestructura esencial, por el momento el ACNUR no está promoviendo la repatriación voluntaria a gran escala a Siria.\\n\\n**Moratoria sobre los retornos forzados**\\n\\n4\\\\. En este momento, Siria sigue viéndose afectada por ataques y violencia en algunas partes del país; desplazamiento interno a gran escala; contaminación de muchas partes del país con restos explosivos de guerra; una economía devastada y una crisis humanitaria a gran escala, con más de 16 millones de personas que ya necesitaban asistencia humanitaria antes de que ocurrieran los recientes acontecimientos. Además, y como se ha señalado anteriormente, Siria también ha sufrido destrucciones y daños masivos e incesantes de viviendas, infraestructuras esenciales y tierras agrícolas. Los derechos de propiedad se han visto gravemente afectados, y en la última década se han registrado violaciones generalizadas de la vivienda, la tierra y los bienes, lo que ha dado lugar a complejas disputas sobre la propiedad que tardarán tiempo en resolverse. En este contexto, el ACNUR sigue pidiendo a los Estados que por el momento no retornen forzadamente a ninguna parte de Siria ni a las personas sirias ni a las personas que eran residentes habituales en Siria, incluyendo a las personas palestinas que residían anteriormente en Siria.\\n\\n**Suspensión de la adopción de decisiones negativas a solicitantes de protección internacional de Siria**\\n\\n5\\\\.

Aunque los riesgos relacionados con la persecución por parte del anterior Gobierno han cesado, pueden persistir o acentuarse otros riesgos. Teniendo en cuenta la rápida evolución de la situación en Siria, el ACNUR no está actualmente en condiciones de proporcionar orientación detallada a los encargados de tomar decisiones en materia de asilo sobre las necesidades de protección internacional de las personas sirias. El ACNUR seguirá vigilando de cerca la situación con el objetivo de proporcionar una orientación más detallada tan pronto como las circunstancias lo permitan. En vista de la actual incertidumbre de la situación en Siria, el ACNUR pide a los Estados de asilo que suspendan la adopción de decisiones negativas sobre las solicitudes de protección internacional presentadas por personas sirias o por personas apátridas que eran residentes habituales en Siria. La suspensión de la adopción de decisiones negativas debería mantenerse en vigor hasta que la situación en Siria se haya estabilizado y se disponga de información confiable sobre la situación de seguridad y derechos humanos que permitan una evaluación completa de la necesidad de reconocer la condición de refugiado a los solicitantes de manera individual.\\n\\n7\\\\.

       " ReliefArticle(title='The Complicated Reality of Syrians’ Return', body='By [Samuel Davidoff-Gore](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/about/staff/samuel-davidoff-gore) and [Susan Fratzke](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/about/staff/susan-fratzke)\\n\\nFor the [more than 5.1 million](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/syria-situation) Syrians who have been displaced abroad—many for more than a decade—the fall of the Assad regime is a seismic moment. It brings tantalizingly close the long-held dream of returning to a free Syria. It is also a moment of hope for the international humanitarian community, which has in recent decades seen a dwindling number of displacement crises come to a resolution.\\n\\nAt the same time, some countries that are hosting significant numbers of Syrians see opportunity in the change of regime. In the years since the 2011 start of the Syrian civil war, some of these countries began to see the continued presence of displaced Syrians on their territory as a political liability. Since the downfall of Bashar al-Assad, Prime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon, where Syrian refugees comprise one-third of the population, has [called for Syrians to return](https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/15/mikati-calls-for-syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-to-return-home-citing-strain-on-resources), citing a strain on Lebanon’s resources. In Austria, which hosts 100,000 Syrians, the second highest number in Europe behind Germany, the chancellor announced the country will provide a [“return bonus”](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/13/austria-offers-syrians-1000-return-bonus-as-europe-suspends-asylum-claims) to Syrians who return to the country and is working on a plan to return Syrians with criminal records.\\n\\nBut the hopes of both Syrians and their hosts must be tempered by the reality on the ground: Syria remains unstable, much of it destroyed or damaged by the conflict, and unable to support an influx of repatriating citizens. For many Syrians, conditions on the ground in Syria are too fluid to know whether and when return will be safe, let alone desirable. In addition to uncertainty about who will control different parts of Syrian territory, returnees will face massive [housing shortages](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/12/15/syrians-return-to-the-homes-they-fled-only-to-find-them-levelled), infrastructure gaps, and [limited livelihood opportunities](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099051624114042163/pdf/P1787061921ca30fc187161b7d84a5e4532.pdf), particularly in the agricultural, construction, and industrial sectors. While there has been a [surge in Syrians rushing back](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-displaced.html) to Syria following al-Assad’s ouster, many of these trips are likely temporary ones, to celebrate, and more importantly, check on conditions. It is unlikely on-the-ground realities will be stable enough in the near term for individuals to consider permanent repatriation. Depending on each Syrian’s personal experience and their own analysis of the benefits of return, movement back to Syria may not be a possibility or a desirable outcome.\\n\\nHost countries may also find it more difficult than they might like to encourage Syrians to leave. Many Syrians have lived in Europe long enough to receive long-term residency or naturalization, which gives them a right to continue to reside there without needing to maintain refugee status. As of December 2023 (the most recent data available), nearly [180,000 Syrians](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/d29708bd-8a46-4cb7-8eef-523a1c63eccc?lang=en) held long-term residency in EU countries, and more than [300,000 had taken EU citizenship since 2013](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/d29708bd-8a46-4cb7-8eef-523a1c63eccc?lang=en). Less secure are the more than [780,000 Syrians](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/c9c33000-a326-424a-b3c5-ecd9a90e8719?lang=en) in the European Union who still hold refugee status or subsidiary protection. For those whose refugee claim was based on fear of persecution at the hands of the Assad regime, EU law may permit governments to [decline to renew this status or to consider revoking it](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0095).\\n\\n**Guardrails around Return**\\n\\nYet European states are likely to find it hard in practice to effectuate returns to Syria. Loss of status must be evaluated on an individual basis to ensure each individual’s circumstances would not constitute refoulement, which will take time. Moreover, a loss or change in status does not necessarily lead to return—voluntary or enforced. Governments may not be able to return Syrians due to [conflict, other forms of persecution, or extreme poverty](https://www.refworld.org/policy/countrypos/unhcr/2024/en/149254)within Syria, meaning that individuals who lose refugee status may still qualify for subsidiary protection or another status. Family unity, which is protected under the European Convention on Human Rights, may also prevent removals (for example, if one family member has long-term status or citizenship but others do not).\\n\\nThe situation of Syrians in neighboring countries is likely to be even more complicated. The least secure status is held by those living in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. The roughly 4.5 million Syrians living in these three countries either do not have a refugee status based in law or have [one that can easily be revoked by a political determination](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/mpi-flexible-approaches-protection-2024_final.pdf). Critically, Turkey and Lebanon have [forcibly returned Syrians in the past](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/27/we-fear-leaving-the-house-lebanon-and-turkey-step-up-deportations-of-syrian-refugees) and may have even greater willingness to do so post-Assad.\\n\\n*Competing Incentives*\\n\\nBut host countries may want to consider their own interests when contemplating returns. Given the length of time Syrians have been displaced, many have fully woven themselves into the fabric of their adopted communities. Among Syrians in Germany, for example, [almost two-thirds of those employed work in occupations considered critical](https://iab.de/daten/syrische-arbeitskraefte-in-deutschland/), such as health care, transportation, logistics, or food production. Many of these fields face significant labor force shortages.\\n\\nPromoting large-scale returns to a post-conflict zone also runs the risk of destabilizing whatever Syrian governance structure emerges at a time when both Syria’s neighbors and governments in Europe have a keen interest in reducing tensions and potential for conflict in the Middle East. A push for rapid return is thus unlikely to be in anyone’s best interest.\\n\\n**Achieving a Win-Win for Syrians and their Hosts**\\n\\nWhile much of the decision-making regarding the future of Syria must be done by Syrians themselves, the international community, including states that are the primary hosts for Syrian refugees, has a critical opportunity to support the emergence of a safe and viable Syria that can facilitate the repatriation of all Syrians who want to return. In the migration realm, this includes making well thought-through policy decisions that balance Syrians’ desire to remain and to return.\\n\\nFirst, host countries must recognize that the departure of Syrians is likely to be a long-term phenomenon. It took nearly [ten years from the end of the Balkan conflict](https://www.politico.eu/article/bosnia-refugees-bitter-lesson-ukraine-war) for half of the 2 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Bosnia and Herzegovina to return to their homes; it has similarly taken [years for Ivoirian refugees to head back](https://www.unhcr.org/news/news-releases/unhcr-recommends-cessation-refugee-status-ivorians) to Côte d’Ivoire, with some displaced in 2002 only returning in 2022. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in its [most recent guidance](https://www.refworld.org/policy/countrypos/unhcr/2024/en/149254), noted that Syria is not yet safe for return, and that repatriation should only occur once security, humanitarian, and societal challenges are addressed. States should be well aware of how long it will take for that to occur.\\n\\nHost governments also need to reassure Syrians that there is stability in their status over the short term. While it is reasonable to suspend asylum adjudication until information about Syrian country conditions is updated—[a step already happening across Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/09/uk-and-other-european-states-suspend-syrians-asylum-applications)—nebulous announcements that there soon will be a reconsideration of refugee status is unwise without context about its connection to return. This could set off unnecessary panic, with unintended consequences such as refugees deciding to withdraw from society and hide from authorities or choosing to move to another country where they think they may not be repatriated. Instead, if states are planning on revisiting status determinations, they should clearly outline what would happen to Syrians who lose their status, what the timeline for review would be, and what the criteria will be for enforced returns, if it comes to that. [International guidelines](https://migrationnetwork.un.org/system/files/resources_files/WG5%20Return%20and%20Reintegration%20Checklist%20formatted%20%28002%29.pdf) can help states identify what information should be provided to potential returnees. It is also important that politicians not make promises to their populations that they cannot keep—if courts are likely to halt deportations to Syria, for example, then policymakers should not promise the contrary.\\n\\nWhen returns do happen, countries of asylum will need to ensure that they are done in a way that enables returnees to reintegrate in a sustainable way. States may wish to consider allowing individuals returning to a post-conflict zone to make preparatory trips to Syria to check security conditions, secure housing, or find work. This facilitates a smoother transition. At present, however, some countries will cancel an individual’s refugee status if they return home for even a short visit, on the grounds that this disproves their fear of return. Instead, countries may want to consider how to allow for some level of circularity that allows for Syrians to move back and forth while preparing for return, with the understanding that these “[go-and-see” visits](https://kujenga-amani.ssrc.org/2024/03/06/between-go-and-see-and-come-and-tell-visits-reflections-on-the-repatriation-decision-making-process-of-rwandan-refugees-in-uganda/) may reinforce perceptions that Syria is not yet safe for return. Allowing for some level of circularity or facilitating expedited access to permanent residency would also give Syrians the ability to maintain socioeconomic links to asylum countries, while facilitating financial and knowledge transfer back to Syria.\\n\\nSustainable return is also enhanced by the [provision of reintegration support](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/mpi-reintegration-development-2023_final.pdf), and donor states should consider givng this assistance not only to the Syrians they hosted but also those living in Syria’s neighbors. This can include individual assistance such as direct cash grants as well as community livelihoods initiatives that target both returnees and existing residents. In the future, broader capacity support for the Syrian government and its institutions to reconnect repatriates with national systems and social services, such as one-stop shops that bring together multiple ministries and agencies to support returnees, could also be useful. But this support must be robust and durable—a one-time 1,000-euro “return bonus” will not go far in helping Syrians reintegrate.\\n\\nFinally, if host countries want return to be sustainable, they will need to make investments in the stability of Syria, including by continuing—and in fact increasing—their development support to Syria and its neighbors (as the [European Union has already started to do](https://www.barrons.com/amp/news/eu-announces-extra-one-bn-euros-in-refugee-funding-for-turkey-6beb9456)). Syria needs significant infrastructure, governance, and public service support, contingent on the new government demonstrating an intent to govern fairly and inclusively, to stabilize the country and to make sure it is equipped to handle returns and reintegration. Similarly, Syria’s neighbors will continue to require support to maintain the refugee populations that will remain, either due to their fear of safety in Syria or unwillingness to return. There is also the likelihood that Turkey and Jordan, in particular, may serve as a temporary staging ground for displaced Syrians from other countries before they enter Syria, and as a result should receive donor state support for these transitional populations.\\n\\nWhether and when Syria will be safe and desirable for voluntary repatriation remains to be seen. The most optimistic scenario is one where Syria has an inclusive, stable, democratically elected government. But countries of asylum need to prepare for less optimistic outcomes as well, which will preclude involuntary returns. By planning for both possibilities, countries of asylum will be best positioned to support the Syrians who wish to return and provide a safety net lest that prove impossible.', original_date='2024-12-19T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Children like Enas benefit from physiotherapy sessions, psychological support and group activities. These moments of play and interaction with other children with prostheses create a space for sharing and solidarity.

Enas a rapidement reçu sa première prothèse, un équipement simple mais essentiel qui va changer son quotidien.\\n\\nGrâce à l’accompagnement de l’équipe de l’hôpital Aqrabat, elle a commencé à trouver son équilibre puis à marcher, mais surtout, à découvrir le monde qui l’entoure.\\n\\nPour cette petite fille, marcher, c’est pouvoir jouer à cache-cache dans la cour, courir vers ses amies ou encore se lever pour répondre à une question en classe. La capacité de se déplacer de manière autonome, c’est s’affirmer, participer à différentes activités, et se sentir intégrée.\\n\\n## Une prothèse adaptée à chaque étape de la vie d’Enas\\n\\nDepuis ce jour, Enas a grandi, et avec elle, ses besoins ont évolué. Elle a reçu quatre prothèses différentes au fil des ans, chacune adaptée à sa croissance et à ses progrès. Chaque renouvellement implique toutefois une période d’apprentissage : marcher, courir, grimper avec une nouvelle prothèse demande de la patience. D’après Fatima, la technicienne prothésiste qui s’occupe d’Enas depuis ses 2 ans, la jeune fille a relevé ces défis avec brio :\\n\\n*« Enas s’est parfaitement habituée. Elle considère sa prothèse comme une partie intégrante d’elle-même. »*\\n\\nLes techniciens de l’hôpital d’Aqrabat, en lien étroit avec les équipes de réadaptation, s’assurent que chaque prothèse est adaptée, fonctionnelle mais aussi confortable. Ce travail minutieux permet à des personnes comme Enas d’acquérir une autonomie de mouvement précieuse. Grâce au travail des équipes de réadaptation, Enas peut désormais courir, jouer ou grimper avec ses amies.\\n\\n## Un lieu de soin et de solidarité\\n\\nLa réadaptation est un processus global, qui vise à restaurer l’autonomie et à permettre à chaque personne de vivre pleinement. Grâce aux efforts des équipes HI et de l’hôpital, ces séances deviennent aussi des instants de complicité et d’apprentissage. Les enfants apprennent non seulement à marcher ou courir, mais aussi à rêver et à se projeter dans l’avenir.\\n\\nL’hôpital Aqrabat, partenaire de HI, ne propose pas seulement des prothèses. Les enfants comme Enas bénéficient de séances de kinésithérapie, d’un accompagnement psychologique et d’activités collectives. Ces moments de jeu et d’interaction avec d’autres enfants porteurs de prothèses créent ainsi un espace de partage et de solidarité. Cet environnement bienveillant, maintenu tout au long du processus de réadaptation, permet une relation de confiance entre Enas et l’équipe de l’Hôpital Aqrabat :\\n\\n*« Enas m’aime beaucoup, et je l’aime tout autant »*, confie Fatima.\\n\\n## L’autonomie retrouvée\\n\\nAujourd’hui, Enas est une petite fille épanouie et pleine de vie. Ses journées sont rythmées par les jeux avec ses deux sœurs, les éclats de rire avec ses amies et les cours à l’école maternelle. Pour Enas, ce n’est qu’un début. Inspirée par l’aide qu’elle a reçue, elle nourrit déjà un rêve : devenir médecin pour aider, à son tour, d’autres enfants à retrouver leur autonomie :\\n\\n*« Un jour, je poserai des prothèses aux personnes qui en ont besoin »*, déclare-t-elle fièrement.', original_date='2024-12-19T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

This area, ravaged by years of conflict, bears the scars of incessant bombing and fighting between the Syrian army and opposition groups.\\n\\nHere, houses have been gutted, the walls in the streets are riddled with bullet holes and the sound of shelling and drones is omnipresent. But for Mohamed, the war is more than just an oppressive environment: it has left an indelible mark on his body.\\n\\n## Amputated after stepping on an explosive remnant of war\\n\\nFour years ago, while playing behind his house, Mohamed stepped on an explosive remnant of war. The explosion caused him to haemorrhage and lose consciousness. He was rushed to hospital where his left leg was amputated below the knee.\\n\\nThe accident turned his life upside down.

Islamic Relief teams have started programmes to raise awareness of dangerous locations and inform communities of the dangers.\\n- The economic crisis – compounded by high exchange rates, commodity shortages and international sanctions on Syria – has pushed record numbers of families into poverty. In the northwest, 90% of people are now unemployed, and even people with good jobs are struggling to afford basic necessities as prices rise. An Islamic Relief aid worker in Damascus reports that doctors and teachers earn just $35 and $20 a month respectively, while the cost of meat has risen to about $10 a kilo. The sanctions and restrictions on the banking system also make it harder for humanitarian agencies to scale up operations and delay payments for crucial services.\\n\\nIslamic Relief is calling on the international community to step up support for reconstruction and recovery efforts – by rebuilding essential infrastructure, guided by the needs and wishes of local communities, and getting the banking system functioning again.\\n\\nPeople are also facing an extremely uncertain security situation.

Now, that dream will come true,” said Lana, a 33-year-old mother of two who fled her hometown of Zabadani in Syria in 2013 to Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, an area largely targeted and heavily damaged by the Israeli attacks that began in August. Like hundreds of thousands of other Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Lana endured years of discrimination and hardship. These days, she takes pride in how despite all the obstacles of life as a “refugee” in Lebanon, she managed to complete her degree in psychology.\\n\\n“My dream is to go back to Syria and support my people. I can’t practice nor have a clinic in Lebanon, but in my own hometown, I can do what I love. I can serve those who need my help.” Married to a Lebanese-Syrian man, Lana’s only chance for access to higher education was by way of her husband’s Lebanese status.\\n\\nLebanon, home to the [largest number](https://www.unhcr.org/lb/at-a-glance) of refugees per capita in the world, including [1.5 million ](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/operations/lebanon)Syrian refugees (including those who are unregistered this figure is likely closer to 2 million) in addition to the nearly 500,000 [Palestinian refugees](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon), faces an acute humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the country’s economic collapse, political instability, and recent Israel-Hezbollah war that displaced more than a million people. Both the Syrian and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon face systemic restrictions on employment, education, movement, and property ownership, trapping many in cyclical dependency and vulnerability. In addition, Lebanon’s crumbled state of affairs have for long harbored ground for systematic discrimination against the refugee population.\\n\\n“With the recent Israeli attacks in Lebanon, the same trauma I experienced in Syria came back,” explained Lana, adding how hard she tried to work on her own trauma while being strong for her children and elderly parents.\\n\\nLana recalls leaving her studies at Damascus University in 2013 after threats of detention by the Assad regime’s Internal Security Forces. She, as well as other classmates and friends, were targeted for sharing anti-regime posts on Facebook—a charge so simple, yet detrimental for Syrians under Assad’s ferocious police state.\\n\\n“So many of my friends and classmates were arrested—with some still missing. I have friends in Sednaya prison, including one who disappeared right after our last meeting.” Lana’s voice trembled as she talked about her friend, a journalism student who just two days after his initial release from detention was arrested again by the security forces and taken to what many are calling “Assad’s slaughterhouse.” “He told me he’s going to his mother’s house, but on his way home, they took him. I was the last person to see him since.”\\n\\nCharged with an exuberant joy since Assad’s fall last Sunday, Lana is counting the days until she can return home. “I want to leave tomorrow if I can, but I know we need some planning.” She explained as she underscored the enormous travails her family undertook to pay insiders in Syria in an effort to remove her name from the regime’s “security list.”\\n\\n“I wasn’t successful. I’m still on that list,” said Lana. However, in the past few years, her now 6-year-old son Mohammad-Ali has visited the ruins of his mother’s home during his few visits to Zabadani with his father.\\n\\n> “I always wanted him to see my hometown, where I came from. Then the morning of Assad’s fall, when Mohammad-Ali found out that I can now go back, he turned to me and said, Mama let’s go home—let’s go.”\\n\\nHigh on the promise of a new dawn for Syria, Lana shared her trust for HTS. “Assad did brutal things to his fellow Syrians; anyone other than Assad is better. I hope all Syrians would live in peace, and I think the free army will protect people. From my heart, I hope this. I believe this.”\\n\\n## **A Palestinian in Syria**\\n\\nMiles away in Killis, Turkey, 32-year-old Baraa’s joy mirrors that of Lana’s. “I am Palestinian, but I was born in Syria, so if Palestine is the heart, Syria will be the soul,” said Baraa, taking joy in Syria’s presumed liberation post-Assad while grieving the fate of Palestine.\\n\\n“Assad’s fall means that I may have the hope of seeing my family again in Syria or maybe visiting my dad’s grave. It means that for the first time, my children will know the meaning of grandfather or grandmother. It means that maybe, just maybe, I can return to Damascus, to Yarmouk, to my memories.” Though for this once computer engineering student the pain remains multifold.\\n\\nBaraa is one of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who was born and raised in one of the most crowded refugee camps in the world, Yarmouk, a densely built, so-called safe space for Palestinians that in 2015 was regarded as [“the worst place on earth.”](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/05/how-yarmouk-refugee-camp-became-worst-place-syria) [Yarmouk evolved](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/4/26/yarmouks-palestinians-waiting-for-death-to-knock) into a besieged battleground between opposition groups, extremist militants such as Al-Nusra and later ISIS, and Assad’s forces that subjugated the camp to extreme deprivation and unimaginable violence. To this day, Baraa explains how she can’t escape the horrors of life in Yarmouk, especially from 2014 until she left for Turkey in 2016.\\n\\nSince the eruption of conflict in Syria, Turkey has hosted [nearly 3.2 million Syrian refugees ](https://www.unhcr.org/tr/en/kime-yardim-ediyoruz/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-tuerkiye#:~:text=T%C3%BCrkiye%20currently%20hosts%20some%203.2,of%20concern%20from%20other%20nationalities.)of whom nearly 70% live below the poverty line with limited access to formal employment. [According to United Nations Children\\'s Fund](https://www.unicef.org/eca/press-releases/syrian-refugees-turkey-missing-education) (UNICEF), access to education remains a concern, with nearly 40% of school-aged refugee children out of school due to “language barriers, financial constraints, and early marriage.”\\n\\nBaraa, while grateful for the security and stability of life outside of a war zone, cannot escape the perpetual pain of discrimination and abandonment. “People—whether here in Turkey or anywhere else—have always had a limited view of Syrian or Palestinian refugees and that hurts. That is wrong.”\\n\\nWith only their Palestinian ID cards, the future remains ambiguous for Baraa and her young family. Yet one thing is certain: she will not give up “hope.”\\n\\n> “I have so much hope for Syria. For going back and rebuilding it with my children. I want unity for all Syrians. That’s the only thing that’s going to rebuild this country. But I’m also telling my kids that we have a promise from God—that one day, Palestine too will be free—one day we’ll go back home.”\\n\\n## **Stories from the inside**\\n\\nIn a suburb of Damascus that endured one of the “deadliest massacres” of the entire civil war, 28-year-old Farah recalls how she and her entire family stayed in the bathroom of their home for 21 days in order to shelter from heavy bombings and shelling. “I’d never forget when the Assad forces put their weapons in the faces of my father and brother. I saw my mother kissing their hands so that they would spare them, knowing that we have no support other than them.” She recalled the days that followed: “we then stayed in the bathroom for weeks going through extreme cold, extreme hunger, and extreme fear of them harming me and my brothers.”\\n\\nFarah is now a housewife but has a degree in financial and banking sciences. She lives with her two daughters and unemployed husband in Adra, which was one of the [six areas](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/04/syria-year-chemical-weapons-attacks-persist) hit by Assad’s deadly and illegal chemical arsenal in 2013.\\n\\n“I feel free—absolutely free,” said Farah, while emphasizing on the severe “oppression of life” in the previous regime. “We were not able to even speak or express our opinion due to fear of the lion. Even if you mentioned his name you were threatened to be imprisoned or disappeared.”\\n\\nFarah added how she trusts HTS and their promise of change for Syria. “Since they came, they didn’t interfere in our lives. They didn’t take our freedom. They’re making us feel that we are one people and one nation, here to rebuild this country.”\\n\\nUnderneath her jubilant smile, Farah suffers from partial blindness. A severe inflammation damaged her cornea that required a replacement—an impossible operation at a time when most Syrians lived under severe humanitarian, financial, and medical crises.\\n\\n> “I may not see with my eye, but I see with my heart,” said Farah, who while hopeful about the future of her country, has taken to heart the many years that they seemed “forgotten by the world.”\\n\\n“Now is our time. We will rebuild, and we need the world next to us—this time it has to be real support.”\\n\\n## **\"Support and safety\"**\\n\\nwere two essential needs for 32-year-old Judy during her 8-year-long marriage to her now ex-husband, a soldier in the Assad army during the war. “It was a nightmare. My feelings are impossible to express.” Battered by years of trauma, violence, and the devastating economic impact of the war, Judy works in a small room in her humble apartment in Latakia designing and sewing handicrafts to make ends meet for her three young children.\\n\\n“My husband changed over the years, and when I left, he threatened to hurt me in every way imaginable.” Judy’s husband accused her of “insulting the president,” a ‘crime’ for which she could have been imprisoned or even disappeared. “I could have easily ended up in Sednaya prison. Over the years, I was arrested and released so many times, but I don’t know why. Maybe it was the mercy of God that led them to finally let me go for good.”\\n\\nPraising HTS, Judy says how the group deserves the Syrian people’s “appreciation, respect, and the opportunity to showcase what they can deliver next.”\\n\\n> “I feel the joy of victory over surviving a lifetime of oppression under the shadow of Assad’s repression, hunger, humiliation and slander,” said added.\\n\\n## **Apprehension about the future**\\n\\nSurvival is a loaded word for 66-year-old Manal, who has been the sole caregiver for her younger sister battling breast cancer since 2016. “The situation was very difficult. We went through various phases in this civil war. From the blockade, deprivation of water, food, electricity, rationing, internet outages, power outages, and lack of heating in winter—we saw it all,” said the retired engineer and mother of one. She explained how the catastrophic shortage of medicine, lack of medical infrastructure, and healthcare providers affected the lives of ordinary citizens, including her sister who continues receiving treatment for breast cancer.\\n\\n“The day after Assad’s departure, when I stepped out into the streets for the first time, I cried tears of joy—as if I was living a dream. I stared at his torn pictures and to this moment am still in a state of shock and disbelief,” said Manal. Her sister was due for her routine injection at the hospital just three days after HTS’s takeover of Damascus. Wary and anxious that there would most likely be no one at the hospital, Manal received a sudden call. “Come to the hospital; we have her medicine,” which can cost patients up to $2000 per shot in the black market.\\n\\nAs seen in many other parts of the world, including Iran, Western and international sanctions against Assad’s regime have only had adverse impact on the lives of ordinary civilians while creating a lucrative black market for regime insiders and criminals. “The world worked to impoverish the Syrians, and the policy of boycotting the country had the opposite effect. The president and his gang were the biggest beneficiaries of it,” she added.\\n\\nA secular, educated, and well-traveled woman, Manal is suspect of the new militants in charge whilst elated by Assad’s departure.\\n\\n> “They ruled the city of Idlib with a religiously strict grip, and I am not convinced that they will act differently now. I am very scared, and I can\\'t comprehend this transformation, and I cannot trust the Islamists.”\\n\\nMore so, with her daughter in Lebanon, she is worried not only for Syria, but also the region at-large and Syria’s defenseless position against Israel. “Israel destroyed everything that could serve as a foundation for rebuilding a national army. We are now a country without national defense…in the grip of Israel.”\\n\\n*The views represented in this piece are those of the author and do not express the official position of the Wilson Center.*', original_date='2024-12-19T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The region's conditions have worsened in recent years due to an economic crisis compounded by forced displacement, the COVID-19 pandemic, a cholera outbreak, and a destructive earthquake in February 2023. This situation affects over 4.5 million people, including more than 2.8 million internally displaced individuals, predominantly women and children (79 percent). Many displaced persons live in overcrowded camps with limited access to essential services.\\n\\nThe humanitarian crisis is deepening, and cross-border aid is under pressure to meet long-term needs. There is a severe funding shortage, which caused essential services at nine hospitals to be temporarily halted last year. In addition, half of the health facilities have been destroyed, and 70 percent of health care providers have fled, leading to a significantly weakened health sector in the region. Challenges related to access, equity, continuity, and utilization of services persist amid the ongoing conflict.\\n\\nIn 2015, international organizations introduced the concept of community health workers in NWS. Although a unified package of services was successfully developed, implementation has faced challenges, and there have been inconsistencies in approaches both between and within different clusters.\\n\\n**Methodology**\\n\\nThis mapping provides an overview/snapshot of the community health currently in place in NWS. It followed a mixed methods approach, combining:\\n\\n1. A document review of publicly available documents and internal reports and evaluations shared by stakeholders.\\n2. Ten key informant interviews conducted virtually with representatives from the health, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), nutrition, and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) clusters and their partners, as well as community health workers (CHWs).\\n3. A validation workshop conducted with 36 key stakeholders.\\n\\nThe interviews and the workshop were recorded (after obtaining consent of informants and participants) and transcribed. Data was then coded using Dedoose software, focusing on health system pillars considered for this mapping, including governance and accountability, health management information system (HMIS), health workforce, service delivery, medicines and commodities, partnerships, and financing. Some insights related to cross-cutting themes, such as gender considerations, emergency preparedness, and integration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in community health, were also extracted.\\n\\nAll primary and secondary data were then triangulated and summarized in this brief.\", original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The community health workers who deliver services, such as vaccination, antenatal and postnatal care, screening children for severe malnutrition, hygiene and sanitation are primarily female volunteers who act as a bridge between vulnerable families and the health and nutrition services they need.\\n\\nA UNICEF analysis of community health in 12 countries[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://www.unicef.org/mena/press-releases/underfunded-and-overlooked-just-1-3-community-health-programs-receive-government#_ftn1) and one subnational setting[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://www.unicef.org/mena/press-releases/underfunded-and-overlooked-just-1-3-community-health-programs-receive-government#_ftn2) found that far more could be done to support community health systems and workers and improve health outcomes for children.\\n\\nOf the 12 countries analysed, only four reported providing domestic funding for community health and only five countries reported recognition of community health workers as part of the national health workforce.\\n\\n“Community-based health care is massively underfunded in the Middle East and North Africa,” said UNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Director Edouard Beigbeder.\\n\\n“Despite this, these front-line health-care workers – mostly women – are delivering vital health and nutrition services that save lives. As trusted members of the community, they understand the community’s values and the challenges it faces. They must be better supported, paid and recognized for this important work.”\\n\\nThe report underscores that strong community-based primary health-care systems led by professional community health workers who are paid fairly and protected and supported in their work can improve health outcomes, especially for marginalized or hard-to-reach communities, such as refugees. Positively, in nine out of the 12 countries , refugees or internally displaced people were either providing or receiving community health services.\\n\\nInvestment can benefit governments too. Global analysis has shown that governments can generate up to a $10 return for every $1 invested into community health, due to the number of deaths prevented, the high costs of health crises avoided and the economic impact of higher employment, especially for women.\\n\\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, there are at least 204,000 community health workers, with many more unaccounted for by national reporting because they are volunteers or are funded by community organisations on a project-by-project basis.\\n\\nTo improve health outcomes for every child, UNICEF is calling for governments to:\\n\\n1. Develop prioritized national and subnational community health strategies and increase budget allocations to strengthen community health systems\\n2. Recognize and integrate community health workers into national health systems, including by adopting standardized and sustainable approaches to employing and paying community health workers\\n3. Invest in formal social accountability mechanisms that allow communities to engage and provide feedback on health services, monitor service quality and assess performance through structured feedback systems\\n4. Reflect gender sensitive practices in community health policies and programmes\\n5. Improve the coordination and formalization of multisectoral collaboration to strengthen community health, including for emergency preparedness and response\\n\\n“Community health workers should be integrated into the health-care workforce across the region, but especially wherever health and nutrition needs remain unmet,” said Beigbeder. “There is no doubt that investing in community health workers and strengthening community-based primary health care, including nutrition, pays dividends – both for children and for countries.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://www.unicef.org/mena/press-releases/underfunded-and-overlooked-just-1-3-community-health-programs-receive-government#_ftnref1) Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morrocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen\\n\\n[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://www.unicef.org/mena/press-releases/underfunded-and-overlooked-just-1-3-community-health-programs-receive-government#_ftnref2) Northwest Syria\\n\\n### Media contacts\\n\\n**Ammar Ammar**\\n\\nRegional Chief of Advocacy and Communication\\n\\nUNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Office\\n\\nTel: 00962791837388\\n\\nEmail: aammar@unicef.org\\n\\n**Salim Oweis**\\n\\nCommunication Officer\\n\\nUNICEF MENA\\n\\nTel: 00962799365212\\n\\nEmail: soweis@unicef.org\\n\\n### Additional resources\\n\\n[**Read the Closing the Gap Report and the Country-Specific Brief Reports**](https://www.unicef.org/mena/insights-community-health-middle-east-and-north-africa-region)\\n\\n[**Access multimedia assets here**](https://weshare.unicef.org/Share/ea13163ad8otj2o32f00b4lcg8h4n2s4)', original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Geir O Pedersen Briefing to the Security Council (17 December 2024)', body=\"*AS DELIVERED*\\n\\nThank you Madam President,\\n\\n1. I'm now briefing you from Syria. I'm here together with my Deputy and as you just rightly said Tom Fletcher is also here, and will be briefing you on the humanitarian situation. Of course, what we have seen during the last few weeks are events of historic proportions.\\n2. After the Assad regime that ruled Syria for some 54 years fell in two short weeks, Syria faces a wholly new reality.\\n3. Let me start by reiterating my sincere condolences for the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have lost loved ones over these nearly 14 years of conflict, and my solidarity with the millions who faced displacement, exile, destruction, detention, abuse, suffering and loss through the conflict, and also for decades under the former regime. I express my heartfelt solidarity with families still searching for information about their missing loved ones.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n4. It is only 11 days since the fall of the former regime. But I have already had the pleasure of meeting with a whole range of actors and my outreach to Syrians will continue. I hear hopes and I hear fears.\\n5. There is a profound and shared sentiment among Syrians that this new situation belongs to them, that it is their moment to realize their legitimate aspirations. There is a great hope that Syria now has a real chance to move towards peace, economic stability and growth, inclusion for all Syrians and accountability and justice.\\n6. But many are apprehensive about the future. The challenges ahead are enormous. I worry that, if this is not handled right by both the Syrians and the international community a turn for the worse again is possible.\\n7. Let me update you on the situation on the ground, outline the challenges Syria faces, focus on what the political transition process requires, and address accountability too.\\n8. As you are aware in Damascus, a Caretaker authority has assumed power, installed by the leadership of the Military Operations Command the dominant armed coalition in Syria, which is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its commander Ahmed al-Sharaa. So far, this Caretaker authority is composed of Ministers from the Syrian Salvation Government that had been the de facto governing authority in Idlib for some years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir.\\n9. At the same time, and this is important Madam President, there are armed opposition groups that operate outside of the Military Operations Command for instance, parts of the Syrian National Army, most of which acts under the auspices of the opposition Syrian National Coalition.\\n10. In addition, the northeast as well as in some neighbourhoods of Aleppo city remains under the control of the SDF, supported by the US. There have been significant hostilities in the last two weeks, before a ceasefire was brokered between Turkiye and the United States along the Euphrates river. A five-day ceasefire has now expired and I am seriously concerned about reports of military escalation, as well reports of military build-ups. Such an escalation could be catastrophic.\\n    \\n    Madam President,\\n11. Moreover, there is a new situation in the southwest. UNDOF continues to observe IDF personnel and equipment in multiple locations in the area of separation and one location in the area of limitation in the vicinity of the Bravo line. There are media reports of Israeli advances several kilometres into Syrian territory. Israel has carried out more than 350 strikes on military facilities, equipment and supplies across Syria since the former regime fell and these continue including an enormous attack in Tartous.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n12. Such attacks place a battered civilian population at further risk and undermine the prospects of an orderly political transition. We have also seen reports of the Israeli cabinet's plan to expand settlements in the Golan. Israel must cease all settlement activity in the occupied Syrian Golan, which are illegal. Attacks on territorial integrity must stop.\\n    \\n    Madam President,\\n13. Let me now move to the challenges Syria faces. This brings me to the first major challenge ± the conflict has not ended yet. Yes, we are seeing a Syria that is stable at present in many parts. Many in Damascus tell me that law and order improved significantly after two initial days of instability. But stability can be fragile in many parts of Syria, and in the northeast there are still front-lines and open hostilities in which civilians are being killed, injured and displaced. Civilians must be protected wherever they are. There must be de-escalations towards a nationwide ceasefire, as well as efforts to address tensions between military factions.\\n14. A second challenge is the sheer scale of needs. Ravaged by this dreadful conflict, its infrastructure destroyed, with 90 percent of Syrians living in poverty. Let me just stress that these are enormous challenges that will require all of our support, in a manner that will have to go beyond the humanitarian in terms of economic development, reconstruction and a process to address and ultimately end sanctions.\\n15. And, Madam President, the third challenge is of course political. The Syrian people have sacrificed so much, so that they can determine their own future and realize their legitimate aspirations. We must ensure that the political process remains on track, otherwise I fear new instability.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n16. Before traveling to Damascus, I joined representatives of the Arab Contact Group on Syria, along with Ministers and representatives of Bahrain, France, Germany, Qatar, Turkiye, the UAE, the UK, the US and the EU. This meeting expressed a common belief that the transitional political process must be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned and produce an inclusive, non-sectarian and representative government formed through a transparent process based on the principles of Security Council resolution 2254. The Aqaba statement emphasized support for my mandate.\\n17. In addition, Madam President, I think there is broad understanding that resolution 2254 cannot, in the new circumstances, be applied mechanically. But the core principles have wide Syrian consensus. And while resolution 2254 identified two parties, one of whom has been toppled and cannot feature in the process, it is still the case that a political transition is needed and that this will require an inclusive intra-Syrian process.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n18. What can this look like?\\n19. First, Syrians need an orderly transition that provides for preservation of state institutions that serve their interests and provide them with critical services. Here let me take note of the efforts to ensure this already, in terms of safeguarding ministers of the former government to transfer power, and calling on state employees to continue their work. This provides a strong first basis. But it is not in itself enough.\\n20. Second, the transition must also be credible and inclusive, including the broadest spectrum of Syrian society and Syrian parties, so that it inspires public confidence. And here let me emphasize that this is a clear desire expressed by Syrians themselves. Just as we saw significant military coordination between many groups in the recent operations, now, as we are moving into a political phase, this should be matched by inclusive political engagement.\\n21. Third, there must be a new constitution, in line with resolution 2254.\\n22. Fourth, there must be free and fair elections, inclusive of all Syrians, as resolution 2254 envisages, in accordance with international standards.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n23. Here let me say: I fully appreciate the need to ensure quick service delivery and law and order. Stability is fundamental. Competence is key too. But none of this is incompatible with a credible and inclusive political transition it is precisely such an approach that can enable stability and indeed prevent new conflict.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n24. I discussed all of these elements in-depth in Damascus .\\n25. I met with the Commander of the New Administration Mr Ahmed al-Sharaa and Prime Minister of the Caretaker authorities Mr Mohammed al-Bashir.\\n26. I also met here in Damascus with representatives of the Syrian Negotiations Commission, including armed group representatives, and remain in contact with their leader Badr Jamous.\\n27. I also met with Syrian civil society and women. It was heartening to see so many of them - for years speaking across front-lines - now together, in their capital, here in Damascus. They continue to be at the forefront of the emergency response and relief to all Syrians. Their inclusive participation is a cornerstone to sustainable peace.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n28. Concrete movement on an inclusive political transition will be key in ensuring Syria receives the economic support it needs. There is clear international willingness to engage.The needs are immense and could only be addressed with broad support, including a smooth end to sanctions, appropriate action on designations too, and full reconstruction. It is clear that the period ahead will be critical, and there are international signals that broader measures can gain traction with progress on a credible and inclusive political transition. This was an important theme in Aqaba, which stressed that Syria at last has a chance to break decades of isolation. This chance, Madam President, must be seized.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President\\n    \\n    29\\\\. Finally, let me note my meeting with Syrian women here in Damascus, as well as the engagement of my office with women across Syria and those in exile. Syrian women seek assurances that their status and rights will be respected and built upon in any transitional arrangements, with the needs of women and girls fully taken into account. Because the reality remains that Syrian women these last years have reported significant backlash.  \\n    And not only this - Syrian women must be a part of the transition itself, otherwise it cannot be considered to be inclusive.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n    \\n    30\\\\. Yesterday, I saw with my own eyes the dungeons, torture, and execution chambers of Sednaya prison, a testament to the barbarity of the fallen regime towards its own people. I met a man released from Sednaya just ten days ago, who told me how he was tortured. An elderly woman, also recently released, said she wanted first and foremost justice. Another woman was desperately seeking clarity on the fate of her son - who was detained and whose four children she raised single-handedly.\\n    \\n    31\\\\. Of course, Syrian, UN and other organizations have been documenting this for years, thanks to the courage of survivors and witnesses. But seeing the reality first hand was a stark reminder of the centrality of transitional justice, the need for clarification of the fate and whereabouts of missing and disappeared persons, and ensuring due process in criminal prosecutions as a necessary safeguard against acts of revenge. Without this, Syria and Syrians will not be able to heal.\\n    \\n    32\\\\. And, Madam President, here let me stress an urgent first step: the protection of evidence and material, as well as sites of mass graves. We must safeguard the right of the victims and their families and survivors to both truth and justice. And we need the immediate release of all those still detained arbitrarily across the country.\\n    \\n    33\\\\. Let me say that on this, and across all fronts, I have been in contact with many parts of the UN system, and there is a determination across the system to strengthen the UN presence here in Syria.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n    \\n    34\\\\. Syria is for all Syrians. Now is the time for Syrians to step forward and lead. Now is the time to reassure all Syrians that their stake in the future is understood and that it will embodied in credible and inclusive transitional arrangements. I have made clear, in Damascus, my invitation to a dialogue on resolution 2254 and all other issues relevant to Syrians, so that we can identify a Syrian-owned and led way forwards.\\n    \\n      \\n    Madam President,\\n    \\n    35\\\\. Of course, it is only 11 days since the fall of the former regime. My door is open and I hope in the coming days we can build the dialogue. I understand we all do the massive challenges facing the authorities, and the need to help, concretely, now. We understand the need for stability. But stability will not last long if not built on credible and inclusive foundations. The time is to build those foundations now.\\n\\nThank you, Madam President\", original_date='2024-12-17T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='Conseil de sécurité: après la chute du régime Assad, l’Envoyé spécial Pedersen dit entendre « des espoirs » et « craintes »', body=\"**9817e séance - matin**\\n\\n**CS/15941**\\n\\nLors de la première séance du Conseil de sécurité se tenant après la chute de l’ancien régime d’Assad, vieille de seulement onze jours, l’Envoyé spécial du Secrétaire général pour la Syrie a fait un premier bilan après avoir rencontré des acteurs syriens sur le terrain. Ceux-ci expriment « des espoirs et des craintes », a noté M. Geir Pedersen tout en voyant « un grand espoir que la Syrie ait maintenant une réelle chance d’avancer vers la paix, la stabilité économique et la croissance ». Toutefois, « ce qui n’a pas changé, c’est l’ampleur de la crise humanitaire », a relevé le Secrétaire général adjoint aux affaires humanitaires, M. Thomas Fletcher, intervenant également en direct de Damas.\\n\\n« Après la chute du régime Assad qui régnait sur la Syrie depuis 54 ans, la Syrie est confrontée à une toute nouvelle réalité », a reconnu M. Pedersen en prévenant que si la situation n’est pas gérée correctement -tant par les Syriens que par la communauté internationale-, un nouveau tournant vers le pire est possible. L’Envoyé spécial a fait le point sur les autorités maintenant en charge du pays, tant sur le plan politique que militaire, avant de signaler que des hostilités importantes ont eu lieu au cours des deux dernières semaines, avant un cessez-le-feu négocié entre la Türkiye et les États-Unis le long de l’Euphrate.\\n\\n« Israël doit cesser toute activité de colonisation dans le Golan syrien occupé, et les attaques contre la souveraineté et l’intégrité territoriale de la Syrie doivent cesser », a notamment plaidé le haut fonctionnaire pour qui « le conflit n’est pas encore terminé ». D’où son appel à se focaliser sur la protection des civils, la désescalade vers un cessez-le-feu national et des efforts renforcés pour résoudre les tensions entre les factions militaires.\\n\\n**Inclusivité et justice transitionnelle: des conditions** ***sine qua non***\\n\\nLa transition politique nécessite un processus intrasyrien inclusif, a-t-il été noté de façon unanime, avec une nouvelle constitution et la tenue d’élections libres et équitables, ouvertes à tous les Syriens, comme le prévoit la résolution 2254 (2015) du Conseil de sécurité. L’Envoyé spécial a attiré l’attention sur les femmes syriennes, qui « doivent faire partie de la transition, faute de quoi celle-ci ne pourra être considérée comme inclusive ».\\n\\nAu vu de la réalité des prisons syriennes, dont M. Pederson a été témoin, beaucoup ont rappelé le rôle central de la justice transitionnelle, qui est la meilleure garantie contre les actes de vengeance. « La justice transitionnelle et la justice tout court sont aujourd’hui un impératif pour s’assurer que les crimes du régime ne restent pas impunis », a plaidé pour sa part le Président de la Commission syrienne de négociation, M. Bader Jamous, qui a appelé à établir une assemblée constituante pour élaborer une nouvelle constitution, avant d’organiser un référendum pour adopter la constitution et d’organiser des élections générales.\\n\\nM. Jamous a aussi recommandé la mise en place d’un fonds de soutien afin d’accompagner les anciens détenus et les familles des martyrs de la révolution, ainsi que les réfugiés et les déplacés voulant rentrer chez eux.\\n\\n**La crise humanitaire, un défi urgent**\\n\\nL’autre défi majeur en Syrie est l’ampleur des besoins en Syrie, sachant que l’économie syrienne est ravagée, que ses infrastructures sont détruites et que 90% des Syriens vivent dans la pauvreté, a encore noté M. Pederson, un constat fait par M. Fletcher, qui est Coordonnateur des secours d’urgence, et les autres intervenants. En plus de l’aide humanitaire, des appels ont été lancés à la communauté internationale pour qu’elle soutienne le développement économique et la reconstruction du pays, ce qui passe par la levée des sanctions.\\n\\nLa première étape à laquelle s’attelle le Coordonnateur des secours d’urgence est la publication d’un document sur les besoins critiques de financement dans le secteur humanitaire pour les trois prochains mois. C’est pour adapter la réponse humanitaire aux nouvelles conditions que M. Fletcher s’est lui-même rendu en Syrie où près de 13 millions de personnes sont confrontées à une insécurité alimentaire aiguë. Il a noté que plus d’un million de personnes ont été déplacées en moins de deux semaines, alors même que la Syrie était déjà l’une des plus grandes crises humanitaires au monde, avec 17 millions de personnes dans le besoin, soit plus de 70% de la population.\\n\\nM. Fletcher a expliqué s’être rendu sur le terrain également afin de veiller à ce que la communauté humanitaire ait les meilleures conditions possibles pour travailler. L’ONU a ainsi reçu l’assurance des autorités qu’elles faciliteront la circulation du personnel et des fournitures humanitaires en provenance des pays voisins, notamment de Türkiye, du Liban, de Jordanie et d’Iraq, ce qui inclut les voies d’accès aux zones contrôlées par d’autres parties dans le nord-est.\\n\\nAu Conseil de sécurité, M. Fletcher a demandé « un message fort selon lequel le droit international humanitaire doit être respecté, y compris pendant les hostilités ». Il a aussi réclamé « plus d’argent », expliquant que l’appel humanitaire 2024 pour la Syrie –le plus grand appel national au monde– est aussi l’un des moins soutenus: il est financé à moins du tiers.\\n\\n**Une occasion unique de corriger les erreurs du passé**\\n\\n« L’histoire se répète, mais elle nous donne rarement l’occasion de corriger nos erreurs \\\\[…\\\\], alors saisissez cette chance qui vous est offerte », a lancé aux membres du Conseil de sécurité la cinéaste Waad al-Kateab, une militante qui a réchappé au régime Assad. Devenue réalisatrice de films et cofondatrice de la fondation Action for Sama, elle a dit avoir parcouru le monde avec son film *For Sama* pour faire connaître l’histoire des Syriens. Selon elle, la chute du régime Assad ne marque pas la fin de leur lutte, mais plutôt le début d’un nouveau chapitre. C’est pour cela qu’elle a demandé au Conseil d’agir conformément à la résolution 2254 et d’aider les Syriens à réaliser une véritable transition politique inclusive. « Le temps des excuses est révolu, le temps de l’action est venu. »\\n\\nPour la France, c’est aussi le temps de la réconciliation et de la reconstruction après des années de répression brutale, de souffrances et de fracturations profondes en Syrie. La délégation a appelé à la plus grande vigilance s’agissant de la dissémination des armes, en particulier celles issues du programme chimique syrien. La chute du régime de Bashar Al-Assad offre l’opportunité historique de détruire ces armes chimiques, a-t-elle plaidé, avant d’interpeller les nouvelles autorités de facto pour qu’elles coopèrent avec l’Organisation pour l'interdiction des armes chimiques (OIAC).\\n\\n**Une transition à mener par les Syriens, mais avec l’aide de tous**\\n\\nSuivant la tendance générale observée au cours de la séance, les États-Unis ont affirmé que « c’est aux Syriens d’écrire ce nouveau chapitre », dans l’esprit de la résolution 2254. La délégation américaine a appelé à un soutien financier supplémentaire pour les instances onusiennes et les organisations d’aide, notamment au Fonds d’affectation pour le relèvement de la Syrie. La Suisse a promis qu’elle allait continuer à mettre Genève à disposition pour les pourparlers ou initiatives de paix sous l’égide de l’ONU et de son Envoyé spécial.\\n\\nPour la délégation du Royaume-Uni, comme pour moult intervenants ce matin, la chute d’Assad ne signifie pas que la situation sécuritaire en Syrie va automatiquement s’améliorer. Il faut donc rester attentif à la menace d’une résurgence de Daech.\\n\\n**Prudence donc, face aux différentes menaces à gérer**\\n\\nAutre menace, le projet d’Israël d’étendre ses colonies sur les hauteurs du Golan occupé, contrairement à ses obligations en vertu des Conventions de Genève et de la résolution 497 (1981) du Conseil de sécurité, a inquiété la République de Corée. Dans la même veine, la délégation russe a accusé Israël qui, sous le prétexte de légitime défense et de maintien de la sécurité, mène une opération à grande échelle pour détruire la défense syrienne. La Fédération de Russie a en effet évoqué pas moins de 500 raids aériens depuis le 8 décembre, dénonçant aussi l’invasion terrestre du Golan syrien occupé par les troupes israéliennes, qui constitue selon elle une attaque ouverte contre la souveraineté et l’intégrité du territoire syrien.\\n\\nFace aux changements dramatiques en Syrie, nous pensons qu’il est prématuré de faire des prévisions optimistes ou de parler sérieusement de l’amélioration de la situation humanitaire des populations, a tempéré la Russie en ironisant sur ceux qu’on appelle les « donateurs traditionnels »: vont-ils maintenant être guidés par les principes d’humanité et d’impartialité concernant le dossier syrien, ou alors continuer comme avant la pratique de sanctions étranglant la population syrienne?\\n\\nLe groupe des A3+ (Algérie, Guyana, Mozambique et Sierra Léone) a aussi interpellé les donateurs qui doivent mobiliser un financement adéquat pour le Plan de réponse humanitaire en Syrie. Pour sortir de son histoire marquée par la violence, la Syrie ne doit pas être le théâtre de rivalités entre puissances extérieures, ont averti les A3+ qui ont aussi insisté sur le fait que le retour des Syriens dans leurs foyers doit être volontaire, sûr et digne. La Chine, qui s’est également insurgée contre les frappes aériennes en Syrie et les incursions israéliennes dans le Golan syrien, a souligné que les pays de la région doivent jouer un rôle constructif pour la stabilisation de la situation en Syrie.\\n\\n**La stabilité de la région en cause**\\n\\nÀ cet effet, les plus proches voisins de la Syrie ont également transmis un message d’espoir au Conseil. L’Iraq a ainsi appelé à construire un État stable et prospère, plaidant pour l’élaboration d’une feuille de route claire. Celle-ci doit encadrer un processus politique pacifique garantissant la participation effective de toutes les forces syriennes. Pour la délégation iraquienne, la stabilité de la Syrie fait partie intégrante de celle de la région, ce qui exige que la communauté internationale soutienne plus fortement le peuple syrien. La délégation a appelé la communauté internationale à agir de manière ferme en condamnant les violations israéliennes de la souveraineté syrienne. Elle a souligné la nécessité de respecter l’accord de désengagement de 1974 et d’assurer la pérennité de la Force des Nations Unies chargée d’observer le désengagement (FNUOD) pour son rôle vital.\\n\\nSelon la Türkiye, l’essor de la Syrie passe par un plan de redressement global, soutenu par l’aide et les ressources internationales, afin d’atténuer les souffrances, de reconstruire les infrastructures et de créer les conditions d’un retour sûr, volontaire et digne des millions de Syriens déplacés. La Türkiye a déjà réactivé son ambassade à Damas et estime que la Syrie ne doit pas devenir un refuge pour les groupes terroristes en cette période de transition. Pour la délégation, en particulier le PKK/YPG, les soi-disant « FDS » et leurs affiliés, restent une grave menace, non seulement pour l’unité et la sécurité de la Syrie, mais aussi pour la sécurité de la Türkiye et de la région. Selon elle, si le processus de transition doit être dirigé et contrôlé par les Syriens, il ne peut en aucun cas inclure ces groupes dont les actions sapent l’intégrité territoriale et la stabilité de la Syrie.\\n\\nL’avenir de la Syrie doit être décidé uniquement par son peuple, sans ingérence ni imposition extérieure, a aussi martelé la République islamique d’Iran. Elle a jugé essentiel que le processus politique soit inclusif, dirigé et contrôlé par les Syriens, facilité par l’ONU et fondé sur le cadre de la résolution 2254 (2015). Selon elle, le maintien des institutions gouvernementales syriennes est donc essentiel à la stabilité et à la fondation d’une solution politique inclusive.\\n\\n*A contrario*, a-t-elle dit, l’effondrement des institutions risque d’entraîner une fragmentation supplémentaire, des souffrances humanitaires et une exploitation par les extrémistes. Sans les efforts et les sacrifices décisifs de l’Iran et du Hezbollah, la Syrie aurait pu tomber entièrement sous le contrôle de Daech et de ses groupes terroristes affiliés, leur influence pouvant même s’étendre au Liban, a argué l’Iran. La délégation a condamné fermement les violations continues par Israël de la souveraineté et de l’intégrité territoriale de la Syrie. La délégation a accusé « le régime d’occupation israélien » d’exploiter la situation actuelle en Syrie pour poursuivre ses objectifs politiques et détruire l’infrastructure syrienne. L’aide immédiate doit être priorisée et les sanctions unilatérales contre la Syrie doivent être levées, a-t-elle encore demandé.\\n\\n**NOUVEAU - Suivez la couverture des réunions en direct sur notre** [**LIVE**](https://cms.press.un.org/fr/live)\\n\\n***LA SITUATION AU MOYEN-ORIENT***\\n\\n**Exposés**\\n\\nM. GEIR PEDERSEN, Envoyé spécial du Secrétaire général pour la Syrie, qui intervenait par visioconférence de Damas pour la première fois depuis sa prise de fonctions, a noté d’emblée qu’« après la chute, en l’espace de deux semaines, du régime Assad qui régnait sur la Syrie depuis 54 ans, la Syrie est confrontée à une toute nouvelle réalité ». Après avoir réitéré ses sincères condoléances aux centaines de milliers de Syriens qui ont perdu des êtres chers au cours du conflit, et sa solidarité avec les millions de personnes qui ont été déplacées, exilées, détruites, détenues, victimes d’abus, de souffrances et de pertes au cours du conflit, mais aussi pendant des décennies sous l’ancien régime, M. Pedersen a également exprimé sa solidarité avec les familles ayant des proches disparus.\\n\\nÀ peine 11 jours depuis la chute de l’ancien régime, l’Envoyé spécial a déjà rencontré tout un éventail d’acteurs syriens qui expriment des espoirs et des craintes. Il y a un grand espoir que la Syrie ait maintenant une chance réelle d’avancer vers la paix, la stabilité économique et la croissance, l’inclusion de tous les Syriens, la responsabilité et la justice, a-t-il relevé. Toutefois, nombreux sont ceux qui appréhendent l’avenir car les défis à relever sont énormes, a concédé M. Pedersen, craignant que, si la situation n’est pas gérée correctement -tant par les Syriens que par la communauté internationale-, un nouveau tournant vers le pire soit possible.\\n\\nÀ Damas, une autorité intérimaire a pris le pouvoir, installée par la direction du Commandement des opérations militaires -la coalition armée dominante en Syrie, qui est dirigée par Hay’at Tahrir el-Cham (HTS) et son commandant Ahmed al-Sharaa-, a rappelé le haut fonctionnaire. Jusqu’à présent, ce gouvernement intérimaire est composé de ministres du Gouvernement de salut syrien, qui a été l’autorité dirigeante de facto à Edleb pendant quelques années, sous la direction du Premier Ministre Mohammed al-Bashir. Parallèlement, des groupes d’opposition armés opèrent en dehors du Commandement des opérations militaires - par exemple, certaines parties de l’Armée nationale syrienne, dont la plupart agissent sous les auspices de la Coalition nationale syrienne, un parti d’opposition. En outre, le nord-est, ainsi que certains quartiers de la ville d’Alep, reste sous le contrôle des Forces démocratiques syriennes (FDS), soutenues par les États-Unis.\\n\\nM. Pedersen a aussi relaté que des hostilités importantes ont eu lieu au cours des deux dernières semaines, avant qu’un cessez-le-feu ne soit négocié entre la Türkiye et les États-Unis le long de l’Euphrate. Le cessez-le-feu de cinq jours ayant expiré, l’Envoyé spécial s’est dit préoccupé par les rapports d’escalade militaire « qui pourrait être catastrophique ». De plus, dans le sud-ouest, la Force des Nations Unies chargée d'observer le désengagement (FNUOD) continue d’observer le déploiement des Forces de défense israéliennes à plusieurs endroits, y compris à proximité de la ligne Bravo. « Israël doit cesser toute activité de colonisation dans le Golan syrien occupé, qui est illégale, et les attaques contre la souveraineté et l’intégrité territoriale de la Syrie doivent cesser. »\\n\\nLe conflit n’est pas encore terminé, a rappelé M. Pedersen en exhortant à la protection des civils, à une désescalade vers un cessez-le-feu national, et à plus d’efforts pour résoudre les tensions entre les factions militaires. Un autre défi majeur est l’ampleur des besoins en Syrie, sachant que l’économie syrienne est ravagée, que ses infrastructures sont détruites et que 90% des Syriens vivent dans la pauvreté. Ces défis titanesques nécessiteront le soutien de tous, au-delà de l’aide l’humanitaire: une aide en termes de développement économique et de reconstruction, et un processus visant à aborder les sanctions et à y mettre un terme. Le troisième défi identifié par M. Pedersen est d’ordre politique. « Le peuple syrien a fait tant de sacrifices pour pouvoir déterminer son propre avenir et réaliser ses aspirations légitimes », qu’il faut veiller à ce que le processus politique reste sur les rails, au risque d’une nouvelle instabilité.\\n\\nL’Envoyé spécial a dit avoir rejoint, avant de se rendre à Damas, des représentants du Groupe de contact arabe sur la Syrie, ainsi que des ministres et des représentants de Bahreïn, de la France, de l’Allemagne, du Qatar, de la Türkiye, des Émirats arabes unis, du Royaume-Uni, des États-Unis et de l’Union européenne. Les participants à cette réunion ont exprimé leur conviction que le processus politique de transition doit être mené par les Syriens et leur appartenir, et qu’il doit déboucher sur un gouvernement inclusif, non sectaire et représentatif, formé dans le cadre d’un processus transparent fondé sur les principes énoncés dans la résolution 2254 (2015) du Conseil de sécurité. D’après M. Pedersen, s’il est largement admis que cette résolution ne peut pas, dans les nouvelles circonstances, être appliquée de manière mécanique, ses principes fondamentaux font l’objet d’un large consensus syrien. La résolution 2254 identifie deux parties, dont l’une a été renversée et ne peut plus participer au processus, mais la transition politique nécessite un processus intrasyrien inclusif.\\n\\nM. Pedersen a pris note des efforts déjà déployés en faveur d’une transition ordonnée permettant de préserver les institutions de l’État qui servent leurs intérêts et leur fournissent des services essentiels: des ministres de l’ancien gouvernement ont été maintenus pour transférer le pouvoir et les employés de l’État ont été invités à poursuivre leur travail. « Il s’agit là d’une première base solide », mais ce n’est pas suffisant en soi, selon lui. La transition doit également être crédible et inclusive, en incluant le plus large spectre de la société syrienne et des partis syriens, afin d’inspirer la confiance de l’opinion publique. Il faut une nouvelle constitution et il faut organiser des élections libres et équitables, ouvertes à tous les Syriens, comme le prévoit la résolution 2254, conformément aux normes internationales, a énuméré l’Envoyé spécial.\\n\\nIl a dit avoir pu discuter en profondeur de tous ces éléments à Damas où il a rencontré le commandant de la nouvelle administration, M. Ahmed al-Sharaa, et le Premier Ministre des autorités intérimaires, M. Mohammed al-Bashir, ainsi que des représentants de la Commission syrienne de négociation, y compris des groupes armés, et des représentants de la société civile syrienne et des femmes. M. Pedersen a insisté sur le fait que les femmes syriennes veulent obtenir l’assurance que leur statut et leurs droits seront respectés et renforcés dans le cadre de tout accord transitoire. « Elles doivent faire partie de la transition elle-même, faute de quoi celle-ci ne peut être considérée comme inclusive. »\\n\\nEn outre, après avoir vu de ses propres yeux la réalité des prisons syriennes, il a rappelé le rôle central de la justice transitionnelle, y voyant la meilleure garantie contre les actes de vengeance. « Sans cela, la Syrie et les Syriens ne pourront pas guérir », et pour cela, la première étape urgente est la protection des preuves et du matériel, ainsi que des sites de fosses communes, a-t-il recommandé.\\n\\nM. THOMAS FLETCHER, Secrétaire général adjoint aux affaires humanitaires et Coordonnateur des secours d’urgence, lui aussi en visioconférence depuis Damas, a affirmé qu’en dépit des développements spectaculaires en Syrie au cours des trois dernières semaines, « ce qui n’a pas changé, c’est l’ampleur de la crise humanitaire ». La Syrie était déjà l’une des plus grandes crises humanitaires au monde, avec 17 millions de personnes dans le besoin, soit plus de 70% de la population; plus de 7 millions de personnes ont été déplacées à travers le pays et des millions d’autres Syriens vivent comme réfugiés, a-t-il dit. Il a précisé que près de 13 millions de personnes sont confrontées à une insécurité alimentaire aiguë, la récente escalade ne faisant qu’accroître ces besoins. En effet, plus d’un million de personnes ont été déplacées en moins de deux semaines, a signalé le Coordonnateur en informant que des centaines de civils ont été tués ou blessés, dont au moins 80 enfants.\\n\\nOr, le flux de l’aide humanitaire a été gravement perturbé et la plupart des organisations humanitaires ont suspendu temporairement leurs opérations, a expliqué M. Fletcher. La situation a commencé à se stabiliser, s’est-il réjoui, témoignant avoir vu des marchés, des routes et des centres de santé rouvrir. Les enfants sont retournés à l’école et les opérations d’aide reprennent progressivement dans la plupart des centres mis en place par le Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires (OCHA), notamment à Alep, Homs et Damas. C’est pour adapter la réponse humanitaire aux nouvelles conditions qu’il s’est lui-même rendu en Syrie, a-t-il indiqué avant de promettre la publication d’un document sur les besoins critiques de financement pour les trois prochains mois.\\n\\nLa deuxième raison de sa visite est de veiller à ce que la communauté humanitaire ait les meilleures conditions possibles pour travailler, a-t-il encore expliqué. C’est pourquoi il a rencontré des représentants du nouveau gouvernement intérimaire, notamment le commandant de la nouvelle administration, M. Ahmed al-Sharaa, et le Premier Ministre, M. Mohammed al-Bashir, qui se sont engagés à intensifier de manière ambitieuse l’aide humanitaire vitale. L’ONU a ainsi reçu l’assurance que ces autorités faciliteront la circulation du personnel et des fournitures humanitaires en provenance des pays voisins, notamment de Türkiye, du Liban, de Jordanie et d’Iraq, aussi longtemps que les opérations humanitaires seront nécessaires. Cela inclut les voies d’accès aux zones contrôlées par d’autres parties dans le nord-est, a précisé le Coordonnateur.\\n\\nJustement, l’intensification du conflit entre les acteurs du nord-est de la Syrie et ses éventuelles répercussions humanitaires sont préoccupantes et doivent entraîner des efforts urgents pour désamorcer la situation, a plaidé M. Fletcher. Il a indiqué avoir reçu des engagements concernant la délivrance de visas, de permis de travail pour les travailleurs humanitaires et les exigences d’enregistrement des ONG.\\n\\nÀ l’endroit du Conseil de sécurité, M. Fletcher a dit attendre « un message fort selon lequel le droit international humanitaire doit être respecté, y compris pendant les hostilités ». De même, les civils et les infrastructures civiles doivent être protégés et, comme les autorités l’ont convenu, l’accès humanitaire sans entrave doit être facilité à ceux qui en ont besoin, où qu’ils se trouvent. Nous avons besoin de plus d’argent, a enfin réclamé le Coordonnateur des secours d’urgence qui a expliqué que l’appel humanitaire de cette année –le plus grand appel national au monde– est aussi l’un des moins soutenus. À seulement deux semaines de la fin de 2024, il est financé à moins du tiers, soit le plus grand déficit de financement jamais enregistré pour la réponse humanitaire en Syrie.\\n\\nIl est également temps pour les États Membres de travailler au relèvement et au soutien au développement pour reconstruire la Syrie, réduire la dépendance à l’aide humanitaire et maintenir les services essentiels, a-t-il lancé. M. Fletcher a en outre appelé à lever les sanctions et les mesures antiterroristes afin qu’elles ne fassent pas obstacle aux opérations humanitaires. Il a dit qu’il se rendra ensuite à Ankara pour discuter de la crise avec le Gouvernement turc. Ensuite, il a prévu de discuter également de la crise avec les autorités du Liban et de la Jordanie qui ont accueilli si généreusement les réfugiés syriens.\\n\\nMme WAAD AL-KATEAB, réalisatrice de films et cofondatrice de la fondation Action for Sama, qui a fui la Syrie il y a huit ans avec sa fille, alors enceinte de son deuxième enfant, a dit avoir parcouru le monde avec son film *For Sama* pour faire connaître l’histoire des Syriens. À maintes reprises, des dirigeants, des hommes politiques et des diplomates lui auraient dit: « nous aurions aimé faire plus, nous aurions dû faire plus »; et Mme al-Kateab est venue ici pour leur dire: « aujourd’hui vous pouvez faire plus ». L’histoire se répète, mais elle nous donne rarement l’occasion de corriger nos erreurs, a-t-elle lancé aux membres du Conseil, « alors saisissez cette chance qui vous est offerte ».\\n\\nLa chute du régime Assad ne s’est pas faite en 11 jours ou au cours d’une bataille récente, a-t-elle affirmé. Elle est le fruit des innombrables sacrifices, luttes et pertes du peuple syrien: 13 millions de Syriens ont été chassés de chez eux, des centaines de milliers se sont noyés en mer et d’innombrables autres sont morts dans des hôpitaux et des écoles bombardés alors que des centaines de milliers ont été détenus, torturés et ont fait l’objet de disparitions forcées. « Cette chute s’est produite lorsque le peuple syrien avait tout perdu, à l’exception de sa voix, de son courage et de son espoir. » Pour Mme al-Kateab, ce moment ne marque pas la fin de leur lutte, mais plutôt le début d’un nouveau chapitre. C’est pour cela qu’elle a demandé au Conseil d’agir conformément à la résolution 2254 et d’aider les Syriens à réaliser une véritable transition politique, qui inclue tous les Syriens, de toutes les régions et de la diaspora. Cette transition doit aboutir à une nouvelle constitution et à des élections libres et équitables. Elle doit respecter les normes internationales en matière de transparence, de justice et de responsabilité, a-t-elle insisté, et cette transition ne peut se faire sans justice.\\n\\nElle a donc appelé la communauté internationale à agir, au nom des familles à la recherche de leurs proches qui méritent d’avoir accès à la vérité, à toutes les prisons, à tous les charniers et à la justice. Les bombardements doivent cesser, a-t-elle ajouté. Face aux récentes frappes israéliennes en violation flagrante du droit international, elle a demandé qu’Israël en soit tenu pour responsable. Il faut également protéger les civils, notamment dans le nord-est de la Syrie où la violence et l’instabilité continuent de dévaster des vies. Enfin, l’intervenante a plaidé pour une approche unifiée et coordonnée de toute urgence afin de construire un avenir sûr et stable pour tous les Syriens, y compris les millions de réfugiés syriens dont « l’avenir reste figé et la dignité bafouée ».\\n\\nPendant trop longtemps, on a laissé la Syrie saigner pendant que le monde débattait et hésitait, s’est indignée l’intervenante. « Pendant trop longtemps, nous avons attendu que des mesures soient prises. Le temps des excuses est révolu. Le temps de l’action est venu. »\\n\\nLe Président de la Commission syrienne de négociation, M. BADER JAMOUS, a rappelé que le 8 décembre restera à jamais gravé dans la mémoire des Syriens. Il a souligné que depuis des années, le peuple syrien avait perdu foi en la communauté internationale qui l’avait abandonné. Il s’est souvenu, en tant que Président de la Commission syrienne de négociation, que le régime refusait de négocier et faisait perdurer le processus pour faire durer le statu quo. Selon lui, la justice transitionnelle et la justice tout court sont aujourd’hui un impératif pour s’assurer que les crimes du régime ne restent pas impunis.\\n\\nLa victoire n’aurait pas pu arriver sans le sacrifice de tous les Syriens -réfugiés, déplacés, journalistes, militants, leaders d’opposition, opposition armée, ainsi que les jeunes et les femmes de Syrie–, a-t-il souligné. Il a aussi remercié les pays ayant soutenu le peuple syrien.\\n\\nRevenant à la situation d’aujourd’hui, M. Jamous a évoqué l’aspect humanitaire (80% de la population vit sous le seuil de pauvreté) pour demander la levée des sanctions afin de permettre la reconstruction du pays. Selon lui, la résolution 2254 (2015) reste le document de base pour envisager l’avenir du pays.\\n\\nDans l’immédiat, il a appelé à établir une assemblée constituante qui sera chargée d’élaborer une nouvelle constitution, avant d’organiser un référendum pour adopter la constitution et d’organiser des élections générales. Il a aussi plaidé à la mise en place d’un fonds de soutien afin d’accompagner les anciens détenus et les familles des martyrs de la révolution, ainsi que les réfugiés et les déplacés voulant rentrer chez eux. « Nous sommes déterminés à bâtir une nouvelle Syrie où régneront l’état de droit et la démocratie et où le peuple syrien prendra ses propres décisions. »\\n\\n[Moyen-Orient](https://press.un.org/fr/moyen-orient)\\n\\n[Syrie](https://press.un.org/fr/syrie)\\n\\n**À l’intention des organes d’information.

We have been meeting with the HTS leadership, we've been meeting with other armed factions, including representatives from the SNC, and we've been seeing representatives from the families of the detained and missing, and we've been seeing representatives from the broader civil society, and of course a lot of women activists and a few others.\\n\\nI want to say that of course we all know it's only 11 days since HTS and the other groups came to Damascus, so it's early days. But I think it's important to say that there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria. A new Syria that, in line with Security Council resolution 2254, will adopt a new constitution that will ensure that there is a social contract, a new social contract for all Syrians. And that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes after a transitional period, also in line with Security Council resolution 2254.\\n\\nBut then of course, as you know very well, there are a few challenges. One is that the conflict isn't over yet. Yes, there is stability in Damascus, but there are challenges in some areas, and of course one of the biggest challenges is the situation in the northeast. I'm very pleased that the truce has been renewed and that it seems to be holding but hopefully we will see a political solution to that issue. Then the second, and that of course is a major challenge as you all know, is the scale of the economic challenges. We need immediate humanitarian assistance, but we also need to make sure that Syria can be rebuilt, that we can see economic recovery and that we can hopefully see the beginning where we start the process to end sanctions. And third, but not last of course, it is the importance of making sure that we have a political transition that will be credible, inclusive and include the broadest range of the Syrian society and Syrian parties.\\n\\nWe have expressed to the new administration that the UN is here to help and to assist and that we are hoping for a close cooperation where we can move together on all the critical issues for Syria, and I'm looking very much forward to continuing that dialogue.\\n\\nThank you.\", original_date='2024-12-18T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

After 14 years of war, millions of children have known nothing but conflict, forcing them to grow up far too quickly. Yet there is hope and an opportunity for a better future.\\n\\n“UNICEF remains on the ground delivering lifesaving assistance and supporting Syrian families as they chart a new path for their country. A credible and inclusive political transition must prioritise the rights of Syria’s 10 million children.\\n\\n“As I travelled across Syria, the scale of the need was staggering. 7.5 million children need humanitarian assistance. 6.4 million children are in urgent need of protection services as insecurity and economic hardship deepen child rights violations, fear and distress.\\n\\n“Syria needs a large-scale social protection scheme to prevent the most vulnerable children and families from falling deeper into extreme poverty, as the prices of fuel, bread and basic goods continue to rise.\\n\\n“The challenges families face are compounded by years of conflict. More than 2.4 million children are out of school, with another 1 million children at risk of dropping out. This puts them at higher risk of child labour, child marriage, trafficking, and recruitment and use by parties to conflict. Prioritising education, empowering teachers, and strengthening the education system are essential to foster social cohesion, tolerance, and peace.\\n\\n“Healthcare remains fragile. Almost 40 per cent of hospitals and health facilities are partly or completely non-functional. Nearly 13.6 million people need water, sanitation, and hygiene services; and 5.7 million people, including 3.7 million children, require nutritional assistance. Reinforcing Syria’s health, water, and sanitation infrastructure must be a priority.\\n\\n“Early recovery must be supported by the international community. It is the only way to ensure sustainable, quality services for Syria’s children and young people.\\n\\n“Tragically, as families return to homes devastated by conflict, landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) pose a deadly threat. Since 2020, these remnants of war have killed more than 1,260 children. In just the past week, at least 11 children have lost their lives in incidents near Aleppo, Daraa, and Hama.\\n\\n“Children are particularly vulnerable to these hazards, often mistaking UXO for toys or objects of curiosity. These risks not only threaten their safety but also hinder their ability to go to school, access health care, and rebuild their lives. UXO makes agricultural lands unusable, perpetuating\\n\\nfood insecurity and poverty for returning families. Urgent action is needed, including intensified humanitarian demining efforts, community awareness, and mine-risk education campaigns and support for victims.\\n\\n“In northern Syria, objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population continue to come under attack. Tishreen Dam, a critical water source for hundreds of thousands, has been badly damaged in ongoing clashes. UNICEF-supported teams are making repairs, but sustained and safe access is needed to prevent further damage.\\n\\n“We urge all parties to refrain from military activity that puts the dam, its staff, or operations in jeopardy in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. A collapse would devastate 45 downstream villages, home to 300,000 people – half of them children – creating a catastrophe of epic proportions.\\n\\n“Peace must prevail for Syria’s children. While the challenges ahead are immense, UNICEF urges all parties and the international community to take four critical steps:\\n\\n- State institutions must resume operations to sustain essential services, including education.\\n- All possible actions must be taken to allow robust humanitarian response and economic recovery. Both public and private sectors should be engaged in this process.\\n- Humanitarian assistance must be increased immediately, including for returning internally displaced persons and refugees, accompanied by safe, unimpeded access to reach families in need.\\n- All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law to ensure the protection of civilians at all times.\\n\\n“UNICEF remains committed to staying and delivering for children. In 2024, UNICEF reached over 4.6 million people with critical education, nutrition, health, child protection, water, sanitation, and social protection services, including 2.7 million children, 1.2 million women, and over 40,000 people with disabilities. In response to recent escalations, UNICEF deployed 185 mobile medical teams, facilitated education for 10,000 vulnerable children with 12 prefabricated schools, and ensured access to clean water for over 3 million people. We also provided psychosocial support, protection services, and life-skills education to thousands of displaced people, fostering trust, social cohesion, and hope.\\n\\n“With these steps, Syria can begin moving toward sustained peace.\\n\\n“I sincerely hope these efforts will be realised and that 2025 will – finally – be a peaceful year for Syria’s children.”\\n\\n**Media contacts**\\n\\n**Ammar Ammar**\\n\\nRegional Chief of Advocacy and Communication\\n\\nUNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Office\\n\\nTel: 00962791837388\\n\\nEmail: aammar@unicef.org\\n\\n**Ricardo Pires**\\n\\nCommunication Specialist\\n\\nUNICEF New York\\n\\nTel: +1 (917) 631-1226\\n\\nEmail: rpires@unicef.org\\n\\n**Salim Oweis**\\n\\nCommunication Officer\\n\\nUNICEF MENA\\n\\nTel: 00962799365212\\n\\nEmail: soweis@unicef.org', original_date='2024-12-18T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='Syria: Only a Return Policy That Focuses on Development Will Be a Good One [EN/DE]', body='By [Julian Lehmann](https://gppi.net/team/julian-lehmann)\\n\\nSome events are hard to wrap your head around. After more than 50 years under the Assad dictatorship and more than 13 years of civil war, Syrians are waking up from a nightmare. Near Damascus, people are still uncovering, with their bare hands, the underground cells of a torture prison that housed political prisoners. Meanwhile in Germany, a debate about the return of Syrian refugees is already well underway. The conservative CDU/\\u200bCSU parliamentary group in particular has been calling for a \\u200b“swift plan on returns.” But this debate not only obscures the view of what really matters at the moment – it also approaches the issue of returns from the wrong angle.\\n\\nGermany’s primary self-interest does not lie in the short-term return of Syrians but in the stable development of Syria. Only the latter will further our own security and create prospects for the people in Syria. A good return policy can be a building block for Syria’s long-term stability. But this building block is smaller and looks different than what is currently being discussed. So what would a good return policy look like?\\n\\n**Voluntary Returns Only**\\n\\nIn the short term, it is unrealistic to expect many Syrians to return while they don’t know where their country is headed. German national and international law set high hurdles for the cessation of a person’s refugee status. It does not expire even if Syrians travel home temporarily – for example, to see what remains of their former lives. So Germany can currently promote voluntary returns only. [However, most Syrians in Germany will only want to return once the situation in Syria has improved significantly](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01979183221142780). A modest return assistance, like some German politicians have proposed, will not change this. The German government should set realistic – that is, low – expectations regarding the number of people who may return as well as the timing of their return.\\n\\nIn the medium term, the government should see Syrians’ integration into the German labor market not as an obstacle to but as a core component of a good return policy. This is not only because workers transfer money directly to their home country, which benefits local markets; economic studies on the return of refugees also suggest that the people who return voluntarily are primarily those who have gained professional skills, have sufficient financial resources, and maintain family connections in their country of origin.\\n\\n[Experiences with migrants who returned from Germany to the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia after the Balkan wars](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/migration-and-post-conflict-reconstruction-effect-returning-refugees-export) indicate that those who were integrated into the German labor market before making their way back contributed to knowledge transfer and thus to economic development in their home countries. But for this to work, the right conditions have to be in place. In other words, there must be a functioning economy to which Syrians can return. This is not yet the case.\\n\\n**Support Neighboring Countries**\\n\\nFor this same reason, the German government should continue to support Syria’s neighboring countries so they can continue to accept Syrians and allow them to work. [Studies on refugee returns from Syria’s neighboring countries](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/lab823/Beamanetal_2022_JDE.pdf) indicate that voluntary return is – again and perhaps counterintuitively – facilitated by good reception conditions in the country of refuge and in particular by refugees’ integration into the local labor market. Moreover, returns can also have a destabilizing effect in the country of origin if they exacerbate social and resource conflicts. In the case of Syria, the outlines of such a scenario are already starting to emerge.\\n\\nSyria’s neighboring countries have taken in a significantly larger number of Syrian refugees in relation to their population than Germany and are now also pushing for the return of Syrians – especially Türkiye. But after so many years of dictatorship and civil war, a sudden increase in returns of Syrians from neighboring countries will change the general conditions on the ground in Syria. Available housing is very limited, as are land, employment opportunities and basic government services. The civilian infrastructure has been destroyed in large parts of the country and the need for emergency assistance is extremely high.\\n\\n**Focus on What Really Matters**\\n\\nWhen it comes to shaping Germany’s own response to the situation in Syria, the role that a sound German return policy can play in Syria’s reconstruction is rather small. Other measures promise much more impact. For now at least, the German government and its European partners should set other priorities than promoting returns: they should establish channels of communication with the new rulers from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia, even if the group is currently still listed as a terrorist organization. They must also agree how they can increase humanitarian assistance and support Syrians in their efforts to rebuild the country, especially if HTS is willing to engage in a reform of the post-Assad state that promotes inclusivity for the manifold minorities living in Syria.\\n\\nOnly once there has been significant progress on these steps should Germany and its partners in the EU invest attention and political capital to negotiate return agreements. In contrast to the current debate, such an approach would actually serve both Germany’s security and a brighter future for Syrians.\\n\\nA [German version](https://gppi.net/2024/12/16/so-k%C3%B6nnte-eine-gute-r%C3%BCckkehr-politik-aussehen) of this commentary was first published by *n‑tv.de* on December 14, 2025.', original_date='2024-12-17T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Today, “the world bears witness to the scope of the crimes and violations perpetrated by the regime against our people”, he said, reaffirming that “we will prosecute this regime and its fugitive President \\\\[…\\\\] and spare no effort to secure justice”.   Voicing appreciation for the efforts of the current administration of “President Ahmed al Shara and the caretaker Prime Minister”, he declared:  “We are determined to build the new Syria — a State of law, of justice and of democracy.  A republic… that protects all its citizens without discrimination.”\\n\\nCouncil resolution 2254 (2015) is “the road map to meet the aspirations of our people”, he emphasized, calling for a dialogue in Damascus under UN auspices. He also called for the holding of an inclusive national conference organized by the transitional Government to hold a constituent assembly, which would elaborate a new Constitution and the holding of a referendum on the new Constitution.  Also needed are funds to support released detainees, the families of “the martyrs of the revolution” who died under torture, and the refugees and displaced who wish to return to Syria, he said.\\n\\nWaad al-Kateab, filmmaker and co-founder of Action for Sama, also recalled that day, stating:  “It was a moment we sacrificed everything for.  For the first time, Syrian activists began announcing their real names, reclaiming the identity they had for years.”  She added “it’s ironic how eight years ago this very week, I was forcibly displaced out of my city of Aleppo,” with her one-year-old daughter in her arms and her unborn baby in her womb, and “my heart drives hidden beneath my clothes containing the truth of our struggle”.  “The evidence of our suffering would remain even if I didn’t make it,” she underscored.\\n\\n“For two long, Syria has been left to bleed while the world debated and hesitated,” she said, urging the 15-member organ to act in line with Council resolution 2254 (2015) and help Syrians achieve a real political transition that includes all Syrians from all regions and the diaspora.  “The transition must lead to a new Constitution and free, fair election,” and adhere to international standards of transparency, justice and accountability, she added.  She urged the international community’s action to stop the bombings on her country and to hold Israel accountable for its “blatant breach of international law”.  A unified, coordinated approach is urgently needed to build a safe, stable future for all Syrians, she stressed.\\n\\nBriefing the Council from Damascus for the first time in his six-year tenure was Geir Pedersen, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, who declared:  “There is a great hope that Syria now has a real chance to move towards peace, economic stability and growth, inclusion for all Syrians and accountability and justice.” Detailing the situation on the ground, he said that in Damascus, a caretaker authority has assumed power, installed by the leadership of the Military Operations Command — the dominant armed coalition in Syria, which is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its commander, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\\n\\nSyrians need an orderly transition that provides for preservation of State institutions that serve their interests and provide them with critical services; a new Constitution, in line with resolution 2254 (2015); and free, fair and inclusive elections, he underscored, citing his engagements in Aqaba with the Arab Contact Group on Syria, and with representatives of concerned States; with the Commander of the New Administration, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and Prime Minister of the caretaker authorities, Mohammed al-Bashir; the Syrian Negotiations Commission, including armed group representatives; and Syrian civil society and women who “must be a part of the transition itself”.\\n\\nStressing that “the conflict has not ended yet”, he said that the north-east remains under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by the United States and voiced concern about reports of a military escalation.  Meanwhile, in the south-west, Israel’s continued strikes on military facilities, equipment and supplies place a battered civilian population at further risk and undermine the prospects of an orderly political transition.  Noting reported plans to expand settlements in the Golan, he stressed:  “Israel must cease all settlement activity in the occupied Syrian Golan, which are illegal.”\\n\\nHe warned that “a turn for the worse again is possible” if the enormous challenges ahead are “not handled right — by both the Syrians and the international community”.  Stressing the urgent need to help in the massive challenges facing authorities, he voiced hope that his call for a dialogue on resolution 2254 (2015) and all other issues relevant to Syrians can build credible and inclusive foundations for the country’s stability.  “The time to build those foundations is now,” he emphasized.\\n\\nAlso briefing the Council from Damascus was Thomas Fletcher, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, who said the recent escalation, which displaced more than a million people in less than two weeks, has only added to the needs in Syria, where 17 million people — more than 70 per cent of the population — need support.  “Thankfully \\\\[…\\\\] the situation has begun to stabilize,” he pointed out, noting the reopening of markets, roads and health facilities; the return of children to school; and the gradual resumption of aid operations across most of the UN’s hubs, including Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.\\n\\nThe humanitarian response must be adapted to the new and still rapidly shifting conditions, he emphasized, noting that Mr. Al-Sharaa and Mr. Al-Bashir, have committed to an ambitious scaling up of vital humanitarian support.  However, the intensification of conflict between actors in north-east Syria and its potential humanitarian fallout is a case for concern and warrants urgent attention and efforts for de-escalation.  This year’s humanitarian appeal for Syria — the largest country appeal in the world right now — is less than a third funded, he underscored, stressing that “we need more money”.  All States must facilitate the humanitarian effort, including by ensuring that sanctions and counter-terrorism measures do not impede humanitarian operations.\\n\\nThe world let Syrians down as they endured more than a decade of suffering, he said, stressing:  “There is now, as the Secretary-General has said, a historic opportunity to put that right and support the Syrian people, especially women and girls, in their hope for a more peaceful future.”  This should be a galvanizing project for the UN and for the humanitarian movement, he said, adding:  “At a moment of hope and peril, we must rise to the challenge and back the people of Syria.”\\n\\nIn the ensuing debate, many delegations echoed briefers’ calls for an inclusive political transition in line with Council resolution 2254 (2015).  The Republic of Korea’s representative underscored the caretaker government’s responsibility to ensure a peaceful and inclusive political transition.  Noting the Prime Minister’s statement that his term will last until 1 March 2025, he said:  “His emphasis on the caretaker mandate’s temporary nature is a good start, and we look forward to a peaceful, transparent election as early as practicable.”\\n\\nSwitzerland’s representative called for a national ceasefire, which must also be observed by all parties to the conflict — starting with Syria’s neighbours — inclusive governance, rejection of terrorism and the holding of free, inclusive, transparent and fair elections.  Malta’s delegate, voicing concern about a backslide into autocratic and radical governance, stressed that the rights of women and all minorities must be ensured.  “This is the foundation upon which Syria can rebuild and emerge from the rubble.”  The illegal seizure of Syrian territory is unacceptable and risks reigniting the flames of conflict, she said, voicing support for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).\\n\\nFor her part, the delegate of the United States, Council President for December, speaking in her national capacity, outlined her Government’s efforts to mobilize global support for the country, citing Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s recent meeting with the Arab Contact Group on Syria.  The moment would be wasted “if one tyrant is toppled, only for a new one to rise in his place”.  She underscored the need for the fate of missing Syrians and United States nationals to be clarified, stating that her country will not rest until Austin Tice, who was captured 12 years ago, is home.\\n\\nThe Russian Federation’s representative also expressed his country’s continued support to the Syrian people.  Pointing to “palpable threats to Syria’s sovereignty and statehood”, he voiced concern over Israel’s recent actions, under the “artificial pretext of self-defence\", including its operations to destroy Syria’s defence potential, and its land incursion into the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. “If Israel really wants good relations with its neighbours, they should be built not from a position of force, but on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.”\\n\\nAlgeria’s representative, speaking also for Guyana and Sierra Leone, emphasized that “it is time for dialogue, not arms”.  “We call for an immediate nationwide ceasefire to ensure freedom for humanitarian actors,” unhindered access through all mechanisms, as well as stepped up support for the country’s Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan, he said.\\n\\nChina’s delegate, calling for the stabilization of the security situation in the country, expressed hope that Syrian State institutions will remain operational to restore the social order in the country, and that regional countries will play a constructive role.  “Syria of the future” must stand against any form of terrorism and ensure that it does not threaten the security of other countries.\\n\\nAmong speakers who underscored the need for accountability was the United Kingdom’s delegate who remembered Syrians who were arbitrarily detained, tortured and murdered by the regime, as well as those in Ghouta, Douma and Khan Shaykhun, who fell victims of its use of chemical weapons.  He highlighted his Government’s provision of a further $150,000 to the Syria missions of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to help rid Syria of its chemical weapons stockpile once and for all.  France’s delegate underscored that the moment presents a “historic opportunity” for the country’s chemical weapons to be destroyed, with the cooperation of OPCW.\\n\\nJapan’s delegate echoed the Special Envoy’s urgent call for immediate support to the victims and their families, stating that the relevant bodies should shed light on what has happened to restore the dignity of detainees and determine the fates of the missing.  Ecuador’s delegate underscored the need for cross-line and cross-border operations to ensure the predictability of much-needed humanitarian assistance, adapted to the new reality.  As well, he called for the reopening of 12,000 shuttered schools, and for the rebuilding of civilian infrastructure decommissioned because of the conflict.\\n\\nThe Council also heard from regional countries’ representatives who underscored the need for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process.  Iraq’s delegate renewed his delegation’s call for a political dialogue between all Syrian parties — the only way to resolve the crisis.  Echoing Iran’s representative, he denounced Israel’s occupation of Syrian territory and called on the Council to end such actions. Türkiye’s representative underscored that the transitional process “cannot include actors like the PKK/YPG/SDF”, whose actions undermine Syria’s territorial integrity and stability.  His country will continue to take preventive measures to protect its borders and prevent these groups from exploiting the situation on the ground.  Echoing other speakers throughout the meeting, he said “let us recommit to standing with the Syrian people in their pursuit of a free, inclusive and united Syria”.\\n\\n**For information media.

La Syrie subit des frappes sur ses équipements militaires, et plusieurs zones font face à des escalades de violences, comme à Kobane, Deir-ez-Zor ou Manbij.\\n\\n16 millions de [Syriens](https://www.solidarites.org/fr/aider-plus-loin-temoigner/les-populations-en-danger/) avaient besoin d’une aide humanitaire avant la chute du régime. Ces besoins n’ont pas diminué depuis, voire se sont exacerbés ces dernières semaines. L’ONU constate que l’offensive des groupes d’opposition a forcé un million de personnes supplémentaires à quitter leur foyer, et avec la chute du régime de nombreuses personnes sont de nouveau déplacées. Ceux qui vivaient de longue date dans des camps près d’Alep ou d’Idlib sont parfois allés visiter leur village, ont constaté l’ampleur des destructions et l’impossibilité d’y vivre pour l’instant. Certains ont choisi d’attendre la fin de l’hiver avant de prendre la décision se réinstaller chez eux.\\n\\nD’autres personnes arrivent également déjà des pays frontaliers, comme plusieurs milliers de Syriennes et Syriens qui s’étaient réfugiés en Turquie et qui ont passé la frontière en sens inverse en deux jours. Dans le Nord–Est également, on compte déjà 120 000 personnes déplacées en provenance du Nord-Ouest, et on s’attend à de nouvelles arrivées de personnes fuyant les violences encore quotidiennes dans plusieurs régions du pays. Fahima, déplacée pour la 8e fois, est aujourd’hui à Raqqa. Elle arrive de Tel Refaat, à la frontière turque, et témoigne de conditions de vie toujours très difficiles : « *Nous avons besoin de tout, de soins, de quoi nous laver. Nous n’avons pas de couverture, rien à manger, pas de matelas.* »\\n\\nDans ces circonstances, les besoins humanitaires de la population sont accrus. Abboud Al Ahmad, employé d’une école à Raqqa, témoigne : « *Quand les personnes déplacées ont commencé à arriver d’autres régions à la recherche d’un refuge, les autorités nous ont ordonné de vider les écoles pour les accueillir. Mais nous n’avons pas la possibilité de faire face à tous leurs besoins. Il y a des problèmes avec les fenêtres, avec le chauffage, avec le fuel. Des gens arrivent tous les jours. On n’a pas assez de toilettes, le système d’évacuation n’est pas suffisant.* »\\n\\nLes équipes de SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL poursuivent leurs actions de distribution de nourriture, d’eau, de couvertures et de kits d’hygiène auprès des personnes déplacées, et se préparent à accueillir les nouveaux arrivants dans le Nord-Est Syrien. La situation y est particulièrement critique en ce début d’hiver. Des interventions complémentaires sont prévues, comprenant possiblement des transferts monétaires, des réhabilitations dans les infrastructures d’accueil et des distributions de biens essentiels.   \\nSOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL mène à présent des évaluations à Alep ainsi que dans les villages environnants pour déterminer les besoins de la population. Ces zones ont subi des destructions particulièrement intenses et nécessiteront la reconstruction de leurs infrastructures.\\n\\nLa Syrie peut à présent envisager un avenir, mais la reconstruction sera une gageure. Les conditions de vie demeurent précaires et la situation instable.

She also called on the international community to support UN system-wide scale-up and mobilize resources for the return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees, so when conditions are met, organized and voluntary returns can be supported.\\n\\nSince the conflict began in March 2011, Syria has experienced immense destruction and widespread displacement. Over six million Syrians have left the country, while 5.5 million remain displaced within its borders. Seventeen million people still require aid, and 90 per cent of the entire population lives below the poverty line. Thousands of Syrian refugees who escaped the war are now returning home, many others are assessing whether circumstances on the ground would allow a safe return. According to IOM partners who conducted rapid assessments, some 250,000 people returned home in the past week 100,000 of them from outside the country.\\n\\nThose who stayed during the war years witnessed unimaginable levels of violence and destruction. Whole cities lie in ruins, and communities have been scattered. Since 2014 IOM has been operating in Syria providing vital aid to displaced communities including shelter, essential supplies, water and sanitation, camp management, protection and cash assistance. Additionally, IOM has been a vital provider of humanitarian data. Through its main cross-border hub in Gaziantep, IOM has served as a lifeline for millions, including after the devastating February 2023 earthquakes.\\n\\nA new IOM appeal is seeking USD 30 million over the next four months to assist 684,100 affected individuals in Northwest Syria.

More than a million people were displaced in less than two weeks.\\n\\nHundreds of civilians killed and injured, at least 80 of them children.\\n\\nHealth services, water supplies – already corroded by years of conflict and declining funding – were interrupted.\\n\\nAnd more than 12,000 schools were temporarily shut down, affecting millions of students.\\n\\nWith borders, commercial routes closed, there have been shortages of bread, fuel and other key items.\\n\\nLikewise, the flow of humanitarian support was severely disrupted, with most organizations temporarily suspending operations. Several warehouses have been looted. Multiple aid workers – from NGOs and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent – lost their lives.\\n\\nThankfully, Madam President, the situation has begun to stabilize.\\n\\nAs I have seen this week, markets, roads, health facilities are reopening. Children have gone back to school. Aid operations are gradually resuming across most of our hubs, including Aleppo, Homs and here in Damascus.\\n\\nIt is critical that we adapt the humanitarian response to the new – if still rapidly shifting – conditions. And that is why I am here in Syria.\\n\\nFirst, to ensure that we are coordinated.\\n\\nOver the past two days, I have been looking closely at our systems for working together. We want to further support humanitarian leadership by drawing flexibly from the resources from across our hubs, including in Amman and Gaziantep, leveraging the strength of the system in place for Syria.\\n\\nWe are also finding more ways to work closely with cross-border actors in north-east Syria to align efforts, but also to ensure the safety of humanitarian actors.\\n\\nThese efforts will ensure that we have a cast-iron grip of the coordination effort, as clear a picture as possible of the emerging needs across the country, and that we can direct resources in a swift and agile way using all available channels.\\n\\nTomorrow I will travel to Aleppo, where we are already embarking on this approach. OCHA’s office there is bringing together UN agency teams and NGOs previously working in areas formerly controlled by the Assad government with those working on the cross-border response.\\n\\nI then plan to visit Idleb, where humanitarian needs are among the most severe.\\n\\nAs the situation evolves and following my visit, we will also swiftly issue an overview of critical funding needs for the next three months.\\n\\nMadam President,\\n\\nThe second reason for my visit is to ensure that the humanitarian community has the best possible conditions in which to work. While here in Damascus, I have met with representatives of the new Caretaker Government – including the Commander of the New Administration, Mr. Ahmed al-Sharaa, and the Prime Minister, Mr. Mohammed al-Bashir.\\n\\nI have been encouraged by these discussions and am pleased to report that they have committed to what will be an ambitious scaling-up of vital humanitarian support.\\n\\nWe have received assurances that they will facilitate the movement of aid personnel and supplies from neighbouring countries – including from Türkiye, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq – for as long as humanitarian operations are required.\\n\\nAgain, this includes routes into areas controlled by other parties in the north-east.\\n\\nThe intensification of conflict between actors in north-east Syria and its potential humanitarian fallout is a case for concern and warrants urgent attention and efforts for de-escalation.\\n\\nWe also received assurances that access to people in need will be facilitated wherever they are in Syria, including across lines of conflict and into the north-east.\\n\\nWe have received commitments on the issuance of visas; work permits for aid workers; and NGO registration documents. The Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator and authorities are developing a set of guidelines on this.\\n\\nAnd, we received commitments on protecting and respecting the principled nature of humanitarian operations. This includes the conduct of independent needs assessments and selection of beneficiaries; the ability to choose our own partners – including those who had been working in Government-held areas and those currently working in the north-east; and assurances that there will not be restrictions on employing women, who are absolutely essential to our mission – absolutely essential.\\n\\nThese commitments alone will not relieve people’s suffering, but they are an essential basis for us to scale up operations.\\n\\nMadam President,\\n\\nThe third reason for my visit is to ensure that I can make concrete requests of the international community, including the Security Council.\\n\\nSo, from you, we need three things:\\n\\nFirst – strong, unequivocal messaging that international humanitarian law must be respected, both in any ongoing hostilities and in meeting people’s basic needs. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. Those on the move must be allowed to do so safely.\\n\\nThe missing must be accounted for, and, where hostilities have ended, landmines and explosive remnants of war must be removed.\\n\\nAnd, as the authorities agreed, unhindered humanitarian access to those in need, wherever they are, must be facilitated.\\n\\nA second request – we need more money. I recognize the generosity of donors for the Syria crisis over the years. Since 2016, more than $38 billion has gone to the UN-coordinated appeals for Syria and for the regional refugee response. But this year’s humanitarian appeal – the largest country appeal in the world right now – is also one of the most poorly supported. With just two weeks left in 2024, it is less than a third funded – the largest-ever funding gap for the Syria response.\\n\\nNow is the time to invest in the Syrian people, to support flexible funds so that we can respond to changing needs. The UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund has already allocated $32 million to Syria this year.\\n\\nNow is also the time for Member States to work on development support to rebuilding Syria, reducing dependence on humanitarian support; and maintaining essential services.\\n\\nA third request – we need all States to facilitate the humanitarian effort, including by ensuring that sanctions and counterterrorism measures do not impede humanitarian operations.\\n\\nI will travel next to Ankara to discuss the crisis with the Government of Türkiye. Türkiye’s facilitation of cross-border humanitarian operations in Syria for many years has been a lifeline. I will also be discussing the crisis with authorities in Lebanon and Jordan, who have been such generous hosts of Syrian refugees.\\n\\nMadam President,\\n\\nWhen war erupted in Syria 13 years ago, I was in Lebanon, just the short drive away that I took yesterday.\\n\\nAnd neither I, nor anyone, could have imagined then the full extent of the suffering the people of Syria would endure for more than a decade. The world let them down. We let them down.\\n\\nBut there is now, as the Secretary-General has said, an historic opportunity to put that right and support the Syrian people – especially women and girls – in their hope for a more peaceful future. I pay tribute to the Syrian people for their patience, but they have waited too long.\\n\\nGiving them this support now will take patience, creativity and determination. The progress we make will be inconsistent, and the risks of failure great. But this should be a galvanizing project for the UN, and for the humanitarian movement. And so, at a moment of hope and peril, we must rise to the challenge and back the people of Syria.\\n\\nThank you.', original_date='2024-12-17T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='SARD Rapid Needs Assessment and Response Plan, Syria (December 2024)', body='**BACKGROUND**\\n\\nA series of events beginning on 27 November culminated in the collapse of the government in Damascus on 8 December, marking a significant turning point in Syria. While many view this as a moment of hope for the country’s future, uncertainty persists about how the situation will evolve and its implications for millions of people.\\n\\nThe long-running crisis in Syria has had devastating consequences for the country and its people. Over the past 14 years, more than 13 million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes, and 90% of people inside Syria require some form of humanitarian assistance. The recent developments across Syria will impact millions of people’s lives both inside the country and within the region.(1)\\n\\nThe recent shift in power has led to some population returns, with people moving back to areas previously abandoned during the conflict. While these returns signal hope for stability in some regions, many returnees are returning to areas with limited infrastructure, disrupted services, and urgent humanitarian needs. Ensuring sustainable support for these populations remains a priority for humanitarian actors.\\n\\nNearly 14 years of conflict and economic crises have left 16.7 million people—almost two-thirds of the population—in need of assistance. Children account for 45% of those in need, meaning three in every four children in Syria require urgent support.(2) An estimated 12.9 million people are unable to meet their nutritional needs independently. Years of conflict have significantly weakened Syria’s economy, with severe constraints on agricultural production contributing to widespread food insecurity.(3)\\n\\nSince 28 November, approximately one million people have been displaced internally, including 155,000 experiencing secondary displacement. Women and children account for the majority of those displaced, with women and girls comprising nearly 50% of the total.(4) The most affected governorates are Aleppo, with 542,600 displaced persons, and Hama, with 347,100 displaced. In Homs, 26,000 individuals have been displaced. These population movements include large-scale internal displacements, some returns to areas of origin, and limited movements out of Syria.(5)\\n\\nThe relatively calm security situation in north-west Syria has led to reports of returns. All 11 reception centers that have been opened in Idleb to host displaced families have emptied as of 9 December, due to people leaving. Six reception centers in northern Aleppo are still hosting dozens of families, mostly in Afrin. Since 3 December, over 4,200 people have departed from 1,100 camps and displacement sites, with the UN and its partners continuing to monitor movements.\\n\\nMeanwhile, north-east Syria is continuing to witness new arrivals of displaced people. As of 10 December, 100,000 people have been displaced to the north-east due to fighting in Tel Refaat and Aleppo, according to authorities. Partners on the ground reported that reception centers in Tabqa and Ar-Raqqa have reached full capacity. At least 220 sites, including municipal buildings, schools, mosques, stadiums and residential buildings, are being used as collective centers to accommodate those newly displaced.\\n\\nReturns of refugees have also been reported by UNHCR. There have been “minimal” movements across borders from Türkiye and Jordan, while “several thousand Syrians have reportedly crossed back into Syria from Lebanon through the Masnaa official border point.”\\n\\nThe post-conflict environment presents an opportunity to rebuild not just infrastructure but also fractured social fabrics. Community-driven peacebuilding initiatives can play a vital role in fostering trust and unity among returnees and those who remained in conflict-affected areas\\n\\nAs people continue to be on the move, humanitarian partners are raising the alarm about the high levels of contamination with explosive ordnance. At least 52 minefields have been identified across the country over the past 10 days, curtailing the movement of civilians and impeding the delivery of goods and services.(6)\\n\\n**ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES**\\n\\nThe objective of this assessment is to provide SARD with up-to-date information on the severity of humanitarian conditions affecting populations in Aleppo, Idleb, and Hama in light of recent developments in Syria. The findings presented in this report aim to support the management and program teams in making well-informed decisions regarding household needs for assistance. Additionally, the results will guide the design of targeted activities and the development of a strategic implementation plan to address identified priorities effectively.\\n\\n1.

Millions of Syrians in the country and around the world celebrated the end of an era.\\n\\nWhile much remains unknown about what exactly happened during these extremely unexpected 12 days, and about the conditions that made it possible, preliminary analyses note the catalytic effects of regional conflicts, including the Israel-Gaza war, the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Assad’s patron Russia’s preoccupation with its war in Ukraine. Great uncertainty also pertains to the geopolitical, economic, humanitarian and development consequences in the region. Yet, it is safe to say they will be enormous and resound for many years to come.\\n\\nRead the full analysis [here](https://www.ids.ac.uk/opinions/return-to-what-syrian-returnees-in-the-post-assad-era/).', original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='A difficult new beginning - Syria amid hope and challenges', body='After almost fourteen years of civil war, Syria stands at a crossroads. The German Government’s eight-point plan aims to create stability in the country, support reconstruction and enable the safe return of refugees. Read on to find out more.\\n\\nAfter over a decade of war, Syria now faces a crucial watershed. The fall of the Assad regime has for many Syrians sparked hopes of peace and freedom. The people in the country hope that they can now finally begin a new chapter. However, the situation remains fragile – the civil war has not only destroyed the country but left deep scars in Syrian society. Millions of people are displaced, the humanitarian situation remains extremely precarious and the danger of fresh violence is omnipresent.\\n\\nAt this time of fragility, it is crucial that Syria does not once again become an arena for international power struggles. The focus must be on creating stability and a lasting peaceful order. The Federal Foreign Office has therefore drawn up an eight-point plan to support this new beginning and open up the prospect of a free and democratic future for the people of Syria.\\n\\n## **Stability and responsibility – the eight-point plan for Syria**\\n\\n### **1. A peaceful handover of power**\\n\\nA peaceful handover to a stable and inclusive government is the first and most important step. To this end, there must be a comprehensive, Syrian-led dialogue process involving all social, ethnic and religious groups. This dialogue is essential in order to restore the Syrian people’s trust in their political structures. A ceasefire and the integration of militias into a national army are just as important in this process as the development of new administrative structures. The aim in the long term is to enable free and democratic elections.\\n\\n### **2. Protection from external influence**\\n\\nSyria must not become the plaything of foreign powers once again. The German Government will therefore strive for in-depth liaison with international partners, particularly within the United Nations. The aim is to preserve Syria’s territorial integrity and prevent any external interference. A stable dialogue process can only succeed if regional stakeholders who are pursuing their own security interests commit to respecting Syria’s sovereignty.\\n\\n### **3. Pragmatic approach to local actors**\\n\\nGroups such as the Islamist militia Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have de facto taken on a dominant role in parts of Syria. Their influence cannot be ignored – but it must be watched with a critical eye. We have drawn up criteria for the possibility of involvement in political processes. It is important, for example, that minorities are protected, women’s rights are respected and acts of vengeance are prevented. Germany is working closely with international partners to define a common approach to groups such as HTS, in order to preserve the chances of stability while at the same time limiting the influence of extremist ideologies.\\n\\n### **4. Humanitarian assistance and reconstruction**\\n\\nThe humanitarian situation in Syria remains precarious. Food prices have rocketed once again in recent weeks, and millions of people depend on external assistance. As well as providing emergency relief, in cooperation with the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNHCR as well as via other channels, in the medium term we also aim to play a role in reconstruction in order to create prospects for the people in the country. Meanwhile, it is important for the international community to find ways of delivering humanitarian assistance directly to the people who need it, including in hard-to-access regions.\\n\\n### **5. Justice and reckoning with the past**\\n\\nAlmost fourteen years of civil war have left deep scars. Reckoning with the crimes of the Assad regime and other parties to the conflict is essential in order to pave the way for long-term reconciliation. Germany has already taken a strong stance against impunity, including by applying the principle of universal jurisdiction in German courts. We will be happy to share our experience and technical expertise in order to support national reconciliation processes.\\n\\n### **6. Securing and destroying chemical weapons**\\n\\nThe chemical weapons remaining from the Assad regime pose a considerable danger. It is urgent for them to be securely destroyed in order to protect the Syrian people and the region. Germany supports the efforts of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and stands ready to provide technical and logistic assistance in order to eliminate the remaining stockpiles.\\n\\n### **7. Greater diplomatic presence**\\n\\nAfter years without a diplomatic mission in Syria, the German Government plans a return to the country as soon as local conditions allow. The new Federal Foreign Office Special Coordinator for Syria, Minister of State Tobias Lindner, will to this end hold in-depth talks with relevant regional stakeholders in the coming weeks in order to strengthen political dialogue. The aim is to further expand our existing contact with all forces within Syrian society.\\n\\n### **8. Support for the safe return of refugees**\\n\\nEnabling Syrian refugees to return home if they would like to do so is a key concern. This can only happen under clear-cut conditions: any return must be voluntary, safe and dignified. Germany is working closely with UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Syria’s neighbours to consult on these requirements. They also include establishing socio-economic structures that will allow returning refugees to build a new life in their home country.\\n\\n## **Responsibility for the future**\\n\\nLasting peace requires patience, resolve and international cooperation. The eight-point plan sets clear priorities in order to turn the hope of a new beginning in Syria into a permanent reality. Together with international partners, Germany is working to set the country on a stable and peaceful course.', original_date='2024-12-17T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='How the collapse of Assad’s regime will impact Syria’s mixed migration dynamics', body='16 December 2024 | By Chris Horwood, Bram Frouws and Roberto Forin\\n\\nOn 8 December 2024, after less than two weeks of continuous fighting across the northwest area of Syria, rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) [seized the capital Damascus](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/09/middleeast/timeline-syria-assad-regime-toppled-intl/index.html), prompting the sudden flight of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to Moscow and sealing the end of the notorious Assad dynasty.\\n\\nThe remarkably fast collapse of the brutal Assad regime, after almost 14 years of a destructive civil war, was met with widespread celebrations, both within Syria and among the millions of Syrian refugees living in exile. While the future of Syria remains highly uncertain, many Syrian refugees have already begun expressing a desire to return to Syria with a strong commitment to rebuilding their country. Others in neighbouring countries have already rushed to Syria’s borders eager to return home and reunite with family, along with the return of many Syrians who have been internally displaced for over a decade.\\n\\nIn Europe, states have not only welcomed the fall of the Assad regime, but in a very premature move also rushed – within 24 hours of the collapse of the regime – to announce suspending decisions on all pending Syrian asylum claims, with some countries, as well as certain politicians from across many countries, calling for the repatriation of all Syrian refugees.\\n\\nBut what will the future hold for Syria? What to expect in terms of returns and the reality that refugees and internally displaced populations might face upon return? How might this current transition of power impact further displacement within and from Syria? This article explores **the potential short and long-term outcomes these dramatic, largely unexpected and sudden events on Syrian displacement and mixed migration dynamics**.\\n\\n## **The unfolding events**\\n\\nSince the start of the civil war in 2011, the Assad regime was able to hold on to power largely due to the support from foreign allies Russia and Iran. However, with both Iran and Russia’s attention increasingly pulled elsewhere, rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamic faction stemming from Syria’s branch of Al-Qaeda and with backing from Turkey, succeeded in toppling Assad and his regime where others have failed.\\n\\nSince the rebel group’s quick accession to power, its leader, Ahmad al Sharaa, has preached a message of unity for Syria, and has been quick to paint himself as [open and tolerant ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/who-is-abu-mohammed-al-jolani-leader-of-syrian-insurgents-hts)posing no threat to minorities within Syria, or to the West. However, HTS remains a [designated terrorist group](https://www.dw.com/en/should-hts-be-taken-off-terror-list/a-71038728?form=MG0AV3) according to the UN, the US, the UK and various EU countries. While many countries started paving the road to [restoring diplomatic ties with Syria](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20241215-live-ukraine-to-set-up-supply-mechanisms-to-prevent-food-crisis-in-syria-zelensky-says), many remain cautious at best, and fearful at worst, about how this transition will fare for the country. This includes whether HTS will implement its message of unity since the fall of the Assad-regime, and be strong enough to effectively stabilise the country, or whether IS or other armed jihadist groups may take advantage of the current power vacuum in the country.\\n\\nIn the immediate wake of the regime’s fall, several global players have been quick to intervene, with Israel immediately [launching a military offensive](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241210-israel-assuming-worst-case-scenario-with-syria-bombing-analysts) bombing Syria’s key infrastructure, military bases and weapons centres. On the ground, Israel also sent troops into the occupied territory of Golan Heights, advancing beyond the established demilitarised, “buffer” zone [for the first time](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-israel-turkey-us-strikes.html) since the war in October 1973, and already [approving a plan to encourage the expansion](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6lgln128xo) of illegal settlements in the area. Türkiye too, has been carrying out bombing raids, concerned about Kurdish influence along its border. The United States has also [launched at least 75 airstrikes in Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-israel-turkey-us-strikes.html) to [prevent IS forces](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/air-force-syria-isis-strikes/?form=MG0AV3) from seizing weapons and territorial power during this vulnerable transition phase for the country.\\n\\nIn short, the combined effect of what many are calling the continued [’seismic shifts’](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2514716/seismic-change-in-syria-as-assad-regime-falls) in Middle East geopolitics is resulting in fast-changing and global spheres of power and influence will likely have a **huge impact on future Syrian migration and displacement dynamics.**\\n\\n## **The Syrian displacement crisis until now**\\n\\nSince 2011, the civil conflict caused one of the largest humanitarian and [displacement crisis](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/syria-situation) in the world, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, displacing over seven million inside the country and forcing another 6.4 million [to flee abroad](https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/what-do-recent-events-syria-mean-syrian-refugees#:~:text=Over%207%20million%20Syrians%20are,other%20countries%20around%20the%20world.) – 80 percent of whom reside in neighbouring countries.\\n\\nDespite the initial welcome and continued hosting of millions of people offered by Syria’s neighbours, Syrian refugees in the region – particularly in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and Türkiye – have since contended with increasingly difficult conditions, rising discrimination, forced returns, and exclusion from host societies and more recently, exposed to Israeli [airstrikes in Lebanon](https://timep.org/2024/10/10/syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-face-a-crisis-within-a-crisis/#:~:text=For%20nearly%201.5%20million%20Syrian,injured%20since%20October%208%2C%202023.).\\n\\nIn Europe, the mass arrivals of Syrians in 2015 escalated to become a political crisis, and has been seen as a major [part of the origins](https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/global-social-challenges/2021/04/26/did-the-syrian-revolution-cause-brexit-a-look-into-the-xenophobia-behind-the-vote/) of the current strengthening of populist anti-migrant movements in Europe and elsewhere, again illustrated by the [2024 national and EU parliamentary election results](https://mixedmigration.org/mmr2024/). Given the momentous and lasting impact of the Syrian refugee arrivals from 2015 on Europe’s refugee and asylum policies and debates continuing up to today, the **significance of what’s currently happening in and around Syria for the future of the European migration and asylum discussions should not be underestimated**.\\n\\n## **Potential future outlook for mixed migration**\\n\\nSyria’s new HTS appointed transitional prime minister, Mohamed al-Bashir, has stated that his main priorities are restoring security and stability, [facilitating the return of refugees](https://www.corriere.it/esteri/24_dicembre_11/mohamed-al-bashir-we-will-guarantee-the-rights-of-all-syrian-peoples-a-message-to-all-refugees-we-want-to-bring-them-back-94fcfc9b-a39e-4c94-8e11-d33c8d64cxlk.shtml?refresh_ce), and addressing poverty and essential services in order to rebuild the country.\\n\\nHowever, the challenges are immense: Syria remains a diverse, fragile and impoverished nation, worn out by over a decade of civil war that caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, the displacement of millions inside the country and abroad and widespread destruction of infrastructure. While the collapse of the Assad regime raises hopes of ending corruption, tyranny, and human rights abuses, the transition may not be smooth.\\n\\nThe situation in Syria is changing rapidly, but there are **two likely and, importantly, not mutually exclusive, scenarios for mixed migration, each with further (political) consequences for stability in Syria, the wider region and beyond.** Syria might witness large-scale returns of Syrian refugees from different parts of the world; but also new displacements both inside and outside Syria might take place. Perhaps most likely at this stage, it will be a combination of the two, generating **a complex mixed migration outlook for the months and years to come.**\\n\\n### *Returns of Syrian refugees abroad*\\n\\nPrior to the fall of the Assad regime, more than half of all displaced Syrians interviewed in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon [were expressing a wish to one day be able to return home](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/109624). Since the fall of the Assad regime, thousands of Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries have already started making their way back to their homeland, particularly [from Lebanon](https://www.newarab.com/news/syrian-refugees-lebanon-begin-return-after-regimes-ouster) and [Türkiye](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrians-head-home-turkey-a-better-life-after-rebellion-2024-12-11/). In countries like Germany, Greece, Serbia, and Türkiye many Syrians living in exile have expressed [cautious optimism](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/12/9/syrians-who-fled-home-rejoice-at-assads-ouster-some-cautiously-optimistic), and have voiced initial interest in returning to rebuild their country.\\n\\n*Pushed and pulled…*\\n\\nWhile **many** [**Syrian refugees**](https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-refugees-in-turkey-gather-at-border-crossings-to-return-to-their-homeland-/7893527.html) **are beginning to express a wish to return** they **also face two types of** **pressure to do so.**\\n\\nOn the one hand, as mentioned above, **the new transitional government is calling for the return of refugees.** Al-Bashir mentions the [return of Syria’s “human capital and experience”](https://www.corriere.it/esteri/24_dicembre_11/mohamed-al-bashir-we-will-guarantee-the-rights-of-all-syrian-peoples-a-message-to-all-refugees-we-want-to-bring-them-back-94fcfc9b-a39e-4c94-8e11-d33c8d64cxlk.shtml) in the form of Syrian refugee students and high-skilled professionals, as these individuals are considered to be instrumental in helping rebuild the country.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there has been mounting **pressure to return coming from the countries hosting Syrian refugees.** For some time, countries such as [Lebanon](https://www.achrights.org/en/2023/05/19/13160/) and [Türkiye](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/24/turkey-hundreds-refugees-deported-syria), have been returning Syrians amid rising anti-migrant sentiment, and the fall of the Assad regime might further enable this push. Turkish Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, is already pushing for the [return of Türkiye’s three million Syrian refugees](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20241209-turkish-fm-millions-of-syria-refugees-can-now-return-home/) to their homeland, stating that their “time has come to unify and rebuild the country.”\\n\\n**In Europe, several countries** [**have suspended asylum claims**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/10/why-is-europe-pausing-syrian-asylum-claims-after-al-assads-fall) **from Syrians** following the fall of the Assad regime[ including](https://www.reuters.com/world/european-countries-halt-syrian-asylum-applications-after-assads-fall-2024-12-10/) Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This means that both new and pending asylum claims from Syrians are currently not being processed, potentially leaving **thousands of asylum seekers in limbo for a long time.** The claim is that, with Assad and his fleeing henchmen now gone and prisoners liberated, Syrians no longer have the right to claim asylum on the basis of fleeing his regime. Some countries, [Austria](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/10/austrian-government-prepares-deportation-plan-for-syrian-migrants) in particular, as well as [conservative politicians](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-syrians-repatriation-debate-refugees-germany-deportation/) across Europe, are going a step further and are **announcing plans to repatriate Syrians** who have already been granted status in the country.\\n\\nHowever, **it is** [**still premature**](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/06/need-continue-protecting-syrian-refugees) **to consider Syria a safe country for returns,** pointing to the ongoing need to keep protecting their rights as refugees as well as emphasising the reality on the ground: [90 percent](https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/what-do-recent-events-syria-mean-syrian-refugees#:~:text=Over%207%20million%20Syrians%20are,other%20countries%20around%20the%20world.) of Syrians still rely on humanitarian aid as they no longer have their former homes or jobs in the country. The nation is [‘utterly shattered by war](https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-shattered-nation-bashar-al-assad-middle-east-war-civil-conflict-dictatorship-turkey-refugees/)’ and the impact of the devastating earthquakes of 2023, and assurances for the protection of minorities are yet to be fully realised in action. The Council of Europe also [warned](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/61691/hasty-repatriation-of-refugees-from-syria-must-be-avoided-says-council-of-europe) that **hasty repatriation should be avoided**, while the [European Commission also said](https://euobserver.com/eu-and-the-world/ar8e131f33) **Syria is not yet safe for the return of refugees**.\\n\\n*A new scenario, to be carefully assessed*\\n\\nObviously, the circumstances have massively changed, now that Assad’s regime is gone, as his regime was a major reason for protecting Syrians who fled their country. **Clearly, the grounds on which many Syrians received international protection has changed.** Asylum decisions are based on country-of-origin information and when there is a major change in the situation of the country of origin, it is normal that a re-assessment take place. However, such an **assessment should be carried out with precision and be based on facts, rather than on a political desire to return Syrian refugees.** That takes time and – not least when the situation is still so uncertain and so rapidly evolving – it is impossible to conduct such an assessment within days after the fall of the regime. For the so-called cessation clause – where due to a change of circumstances in their home country, refugees no longer require international protection – to be applicable there must have been **a change in the refugee’s country of origin, which is fundamental, durable, and effective.** A situation which has changed, but which also continues to change or shows signs of volatility – which clearly applies to the current situation in Syria – is, according to the [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/publications/note-cessation-clauses) not stable by definition, and cannot be described as durable.\\n\\nUnderstandably, many Syrians in Europe have now [felt a mixture](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-syrians-repatriation-debate-refugees-germany-deportation/) of joy over Assad’s fall, quickly followed by worries about their future and disappointment with the speed at which politicians in their countries of residence expressed the need for them to leave.\\n\\n### *Further instability, displacement and cross border movement*\\n\\n**The consequences of a hasty, premature and large-scale forced return of Syrian refugees would be severe and would likely** [**backfire**](https://www.csis.org/analysis/dont-rush-syrian-refugees-return), increasing the pressure on public services, limiting the possibility for sustainable reintegration, exacerbating social tension and undermining the chances of a successful and peaceful transition. This could ultimately even lead to renewed refugee movements out of Syria, further destabilising the country and region.\\n\\nThis not only applies to returns from abroad, but also returns within Syria. Before the fall of the Assad regime, there were approximately [7 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/syria-situation#:~:text=The%20Syria%20situation%20remains%20one,%2C%20Jordan%2C%20Lebanon%20and%20T%C3%BCrkiye.) in Syria. While there are indications that IDPs [have started to return](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/regional-flash-update-1-recent-syria-escalations-9-december-2024) to areas of origin, including Aleppo, until now many more – an [estimated 800,000 to 1 million](https://reporting.unhcr.org/syria-situation-crisis-regional-flash-update-2) – have actually been newly internally displaced since an escalation of the fighting from late November. These **large-scale internal movements, in addition to potential refugee returns from abroad – might further add to instability and tensions.** Indeed while return movements to Syria have been seen since the fall of Assad’s regime, movements out of Syria into Lebanon [are also being observed.](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/stories/what-do-recent-events-syria-mean-syrian-refugees#:~:text=Thousands%20returning%2C%20others%20fleeing,the%20opposite%20direction%20into%20Lebanon.)\\n\\nFurther, it remains to be seen whether [promises of inclusion](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-post-assad-alawite-minority-faces-uncertainty-under-islamist-rebel-control/7896499.html) by the transitional government will materialize for the various minority groups within Syria including Christians and Shi’a sects. Out of fear [some already started fleeing to Lebanon](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-shiites-other-minorities-flee-lebanon-fearing-islamist-rule-2024-12-13/) and if calls for unity and inclusion not transpire, many more may be left with no alternative but to leave. In particular, the Alawite minority, historically close to the Assad family and occupying key positions in government and security, now also faces an uncertain future.\\n\\nIf the HTS regime **fails to unite Syria and bring the promised peace and stability so many are desperately hoping for, other groups will likely try to seize power leading to widespread armed conflict, resulting in more Syrian civilians having to flee** the country, adding to the millions already displaced since 2011. This would obviously represent a problem for neighbouring countries, particularly those going through their own crisis, like Lebanon. Further afield, host countries might change their asylum application processes and resettlement quotas, and possibly even strengthen their borders fearing a repeat of the 2015 mass movements and the political and refugee management it caused. Having seized the argument that Syrian refugees should now return to their country, anti-refugee forces might be pressurising more mainstream political parties to be seen to agree or risk being punished by voters. The narrative depicting migration, especially Syrian migration, as a ‘crisis’ – a framing that was pervasive during this year’s elections in many parts of the world – could remain prominent, and with it [anti-migrant, anti-refugee and anti-Muslim attitudes](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/fears-of-anti-refugee-election-campaign-in-germany-after-collapse-of-assad-regime/).\\n\\nAnother particular [dynamic to watch](https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-kurds-rebels-turkey-us-2b4af609c4dcf853ac6d7a22d3dccf5d) is what will happen with Syria’s Kurdish population, who carved out a largely autonomous region in the North-East of Syria. The Turkish backed HTS rebels now controlling Syria could seek some kind of agreement with the Kurds to incorporate them into the post-Assad order. However, the Kurds might not want to give up Kurdish autonomy in the east and this would risk angering Türkiye who fear a powerful Kurdish force at their border. While the US has been supporting the Kurdish forces and maintains troops in the Kurdish region as part of fight against IS, this might change once Trump starts his term, as he has already been clear.\\n\\n## **Conclusion: a mixed scenario and learning from history**\\n\\nThe current crisis in Syria is evolving rapidly, making predictive analysis complex. **Most likely a combination of Syrian refugee and IDP returns but also new displacements might take place,** alongside the choice of many Syrian refugees not to move back yet until there is more certainty about the stability of the country in the longer term.\\n\\n**Geopolitical events all add to the uncertainty facing Syria,** such as the fall out of the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel; the highly militarised responses to Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran and now Syria by an emboldened Israel; uncertainties around the present state of Iran and its intentions; the imminent presidency of Donald Trump in the US; the implications for Russia of the war in Ukraine going forward and the widespread resistance to increased Syrian cross-border displacement.

Transitional Syrian authorities should take steps to urgently secure and preserve physical evidence across the country of grave international crimes by members of the former government.\\n\\n“Without immediate Syrian and international efforts to secure and preserve likely sites of mass crimes for coordinated exhumations and forensic investigations, there is a serious risk that critical evidence for accountability will be lost,” said [Hiba Zayadin](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/hiba-zayadin), senior Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The loved ones of people so brutally killed here deserve to know what happened to them. The victims deserve accountability.”\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch confirmed the mass grave’s exact location after verifying and geolocating a previously leaked video, taken in April 2013, showing summary executions by Syrian government forces and affiliated militia. After the fall of the Assad government, Human Rights Watch researchers visited the site and took steps to document it.\\n\\nResearchers retraced the final moments of the 11 blindfolded victims shown in the video who were all shot at close range and pushed into the machine-dug grave, alongside the bodies of 13 other people. Human Rights Watch researchers also spoke to a current resident of the area who said that a pro-government paramilitary group forced him and other residents to bury bodies in pre-dug graves and dig tunnels in the area in 2015 and 2016.\\n\\nAt the site, researchers found human remains, including teeth and skull, jaw, hand, and pelvic bones on the ground and in a bag collected by residents. Human remains are also scattered on the floor of buildings next to the mass grave, leading researchers to conclude that other people were most likely killed or buried in the same location. Human Rights Watch could not confirm whether the remains found are those of the victims in the video, nor whether more bodies are buried there. It is unclear whether or the extent to which bodies were taken out of the area.\\n\\nResidents in Tadamon said that executions in the area were common. In interviews in 2022, they described at least 10 other incidents of summary killings between August 2012 and January 2014 in Tadamon, Daraya, Moadamiya, and surrounding areas. This evidence suggests that other bodies were buried in and around the area. The area was also the site of armed clashes between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters affiliated with the Free Syrian Army (FSA) at numerous points between 2012 and 2013.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch began investigating the massacre in October 2021, after receiving a leaked video [discovered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/massacre-in-tadamon-how-two-academics-hunted-down-a-syrian-war-criminal) by a member of a Syrian militia on a laptop and handed to Annsar Shahhoud and Uğur Ümit Üngör, researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, and ARD, a German Public Broadcaster.\\n\\n“This video, filmed by the perpetrators themselves who laughed as they killed their victims, shows the Syrian government’s callous disregard for people’s lives,” Zayadin said. “This massacre is just one horrific incident in a pattern of state violence and apparent war crimes.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch worked with a spatial investigator to create a 3D model of the location based on the video in order to establish the grave’s dimensions and corroborate the location and the number of victims.

He said that in late 2015 and early 2016, they forced him, a 15-year-old boy at the time, to come to the area to build tunnels, and pull bodies from the rubble and throw them into pre-dug graves while NDF members shot between their legs.\\n\\nAnother resident said that on May 20, 2013, his mother, 61, his sister, 27, and his daughter, 12, went to their house near this area to pick up some of their belongings and never came back.

Assad’s leaves behind a legacy of mass displacement, arrests, torture, forced disappearances, and the murder of countless Syrian civilians. Assad’s departure creates an opening, finally, for a better future for Syrians – but achieving this will entail navigating a period of major political, economic, and humanitarian challenges.\\n\\nSince November 28, over [1 million Syrians](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/whole-syria-flash-update-no-3-recent-developments-syria-8-december-2024) have been displaced. Syria’s economy and infrastructure lie in ruins, with fragmented governance and enormous reconstruction and early recovery needs. Food insecurity, widespread poverty, and public health crises persist, exacerbated by limited access to clean water and a badly damaged health sector. Displacement risks remain high, with fighting between Turkish-backed militias and U.S.-backed Kurdish militias growing in the northeast. Meanwhile, ISIS militants will seek to exploit the current vacuum to expand operations. Ongoing airstrikes and Israeli military incursions add to the instability. These challenges are compounded by uncertainty over the future of the Syrian state and its composition in the coming weeks and months.\\n\\nThe fall of Assad’s regime has been met with jubilation among many Syrian refugees, a few of whom have begun rushing home from neighboring countries to reconnect with loved ones and gauge whether to permanently return. However, the prospects for the more than [6 million Syrian refugees and over 7 million internally displaced Syrians](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/syria-situation) remain uncertain. Many do [aspire](https://www.3rpsyriacrisis.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Intention_Survey_RPIS_2024.pdf) to return to their homes and rebuild their lives in Syria – but the prospects for large scale return remain unclear. **Mass refugee repatriation will be a slow and delicate process, contingent on factors including restoration of legitimate and effective governance, security conditions, an effective recovery and reconstruction effort, resolving complex housing and property rights disputes, and substantial humanitarian investments.** None of this will materialize quickly, and refugee-hosting governments should expect repatriation to proceed gradually as sustainable conditions for safe return begin to emerge within Syria. Moves by some European governments to halt asylum processing for Syrians are ill-advised and should be reversed until political and security conditions stabilize.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Syria remains in the grips of a major humanitarian crisis. All of the humanitarian needs that existed just three weeks ago are still present in post-Assa Syria. What has changed now is that humanitarians have the access to begin addressing these needs, albeit for an unknown window of time. In that window, it is critical that the humanitarian response rapidly scales to surge in aid and capitalize on the current window of opportunity.\\n\\n## **Building a Humanitarian Architecture**\\n\\nSyria will be dependent on humanitarian aid for the near future. However, the current levels of instability have limited the capacity of UN and aid agencies to mobilize and scale a unified nationwide response from Damascus. The country remains split between zones of military control under competing factions, which continues to complicate the coordination and delivery of aid across zones. The potential for a return to conflict, or a deterioration of conditions and ongoing displacement, remain high. **It is critical to capitalize on the immediate window of expanded humanitarian access to ramp up a major surge in humanitarian relief activity.**\\n\\nIn the immediate term, the longstanding Whole of Syria mechanism remains the most viable humanitarian framework for ensuring that aid reaches all parts of Syria. This aid mechanism enables the UN to effectively reach throughout the country by maintaining critical offices in Türkiye, Jordan, and Iraq to coordinate and manage cross-border aid and service delivery. This model has proven to be functional and scalable and has operated effectively for over a decade during the civil war. It is also adaptable if there is a return to violence, where cross-border assistance would play a pivotal role. Key hubs in Amman and Gaziantep currently have the infrastructure and capacity to facilitate large-scale cross-border operations and ensure essential aid reaches those in need.\\n\\nUN Damascus would play a critical coordination role within the Whole of Syria framework but is not sufficiently equipped to fully manage a nationwide response in the immediate term. Furthermore, there is little trust between Syrian aid groups and the UN in Damascus, as the latter has long been seen by Syrian civil society as too cozy with the former Assad regime. The UN should consider a leadership reset in the Damascus operation in order to establish a fresh start with the emerging leadership of the country.\\n\\nJordanian and Turkish markets are well-positioned to support cross-border aid into Syria, offering a reliable supply chain for food, fuel, and medical supplies. This approach also allows UN agencies in neighboring refugee-hosting countries to monitor the return intentions of refugees and use this data to direct assistance to communities, supporting reintegration efforts and minimizing disruptions.\\n\\nTo ensure success, this architecture must integrate robust local leadership from local Syrian-led NGOs, which have the best access to communities on the ground. Enhanced coordination between international actors, neighboring countries, and local organizations will be critical to maintaining effective aid delivery and addressing specific localized needs.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\nAs Syria transitions to a post-Assad period, urgent actions are required to safeguard the survival and well-being of the Syrian people.\\n\\n### Refugees International calls on all military actors and their international backers to:\\n\\n**Cease Military Operations and Protect Civilians, Especially Minorities**\\n\\nAll warring actors must cease military operations and protect civilians in the aftermath of the conflict. The provocation of conflict in Northern Syria by Turkish-backed opposition forces against the Kurdish-dominated regions of Manbij and Kobani continues to threaten further displacement and civilian harm. The protection of all civilians is of paramount importance. During this period of uncertainty, all parties must adhere to International Humanitarian Law and ensure the protection of all Syrians, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, tribe, or political affiliation. This includes ensuring equal access to aid and services, ensuring a country free of harassment by military forces, and ensuring no threat of retaliation, especially on the grounds of ethnicity, religion, or tribe. Foreign actors must also refrain from carrying out widespread military operations or bombardments that will result in further displacement and civilian harm.\\n\\n### Refugees International calls on donors, including Türkiye, the U.S. government, the European Union, and other UN Member States to:\\n\\n**Scale Up a Syrian-Led Humanitarian Response**\\n\\nDonors should scale a Syrian-led humanitarian response. Donor countries should surge funding for Syrian NGOs to address the overwhelming national demand for humanitarian aid and essential services. Syrian-led NGOs and frontline responders are at the forefront of the current Syria-wide response, but receive little assistance from donors. USAID and other donor agencies directly supported local organizations, including the White Helmets, to deliver emergency services and rebuild capacity following the 2023 earthquake. This model should be replicated now to rapidly enhance the capacity of vetted Syrian NGOs leading the response. Meanwhile, other funding mechanisms such as the UN Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund, the Syria Humanitarian Fund, the Early Recovery and Resilience Fund, and the Aid Fund for Northern Syria should also scale support to local NGOs to meet urgent needs, including providing services, food, fuel, and medical care.\\n\\n**Ensure the Right to Safe, Voluntary, Informed, and Dignified Return for Refugees**\\n\\nAll actors in Syria and in neighboring host countries must respect and ensure Syrian refugees’ right to a safe, secure, informed, and dignified return. Refugees must be allowed to make choices about repatriation voluntarily and safely, without coercion, and with access to information about conditions for returnees in their home communities. Host countries must uphold the principle of voluntary return and continue providing protection for those unable to return. Many people will choose to return rapidly, but no one should be forced to do so. Forcing people back before conditions in Syria are conducive to sustainable large-scale return will backfire and undermine the repatriation effort.\\n\\n**Facilitate Commercial Trade into Syria**\\n\\nJordan, Iraq, and Türkiye should jumpstart commercial trade of critical items into Syria by opening the borders for trade. Neighboring countries—Jordan, Iraq, and Türkiye—must open their borders to facilitate commercial trade with Syria. After two weeks of military operations, Syria’s markets are critically depleted, leaving civilians in dire need of basic goods such as food, fuel, flour, and medicines. The country’s traditional import partners, Iran and Russia, are no longer reliable, exacerbating the crisis. While UN agencies scale up their humanitarian response and donor countries work to reform sanctions for broader aid, immediate relief is essential. Jordan, Iraq, and Türkiye are well-positioned to fill this gap. Expanding commercial trade now can provide life-saving support to Syrian civilians and stabilize the region in the near term.\\n\\n### Refugees International calls on UNHCR, UN agencies, and humanitarian organizations to:\\n\\n**Establish Large-Scale Voluntary Return Operations**\\n\\nUNHCR, IOM, and other humanitarian organizations should begin to outline plans for supporting a large-scale voluntary return operation, linked to conditions or benchmarks for assessing Syria’s readiness for sustainable repatriation. If Syria stabilizes, this could be the largest repatriation operation that the world has in decades – comparable in scale and complexity to the repatriation of Afghans after the Taliban’s fall in 2001. Syria remains volatile, and any humanitarian operations must reflect the evolving insecurity on the ground. With over 6 million Syrian refugees [displaced](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/syria-situation) abroad and more than 7 million internally [displaced](https://reporting.unhcr.org/operational/situations/syria-situation) within the country, achieving durable returns at scale will be a gradual and protracted process that will require a major operational and financial investment. Security conditions, economic recovery, community peacebuilding, availability of public services, and reconstruction progress will all factor closely into return prospects.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the complexity of mass repatriation over the coming years, thousands of refugees are spontaneously lining up at Syria’s borders to return in the coming days and weeks. UNHCR, in coordination with INGOs and Syrian-led NGOs, should begin scaling an operation to monitor and support these initial voluntary returns both inside Syria, where possible, and from neighboring Jordan, Lebanon, and Türkiye. This will require UNHCR MENA and country offices to take certain steps to scale their response: 1) Implement a region-wide survey of refugee intentions for return, 2) implement rigorous monitoring of returnees from neighboring countries, including by deploying observers at major border crossings in Jordan, Lebanon, and Türkiye to document the current return flows, 3) monitor and advise refugees on conditions in Syria, and work with other UN agencies, INGOs, and Syrian NGOs to ensure returnees are aware of the availability of services in their desired areas of return, 4) consult with major refugee-hosting countries in the Middle East and Europe to manage expectations about the likely speed and scale of repatriation to Syria.\\n\\n**Establish a Housing, Land, and Property (HLP) Rights Restoration Mechanism**\\n\\nSyria urgently needs a comprehensive mechanism to restore housing, land, and property rights for displaced populations and returnees, including the recovery of ownership documents, property records, and other personal assets left behind during the war. This should be developed collaboratively by UN agencies, Syrian NGOs and civil society, and local administrative authorities. This should provide a clear framework for transparent legal processes, equitable dispute resolution, and targeted support for vulnerable groups. It must also include provisions for alternative housing solutions and financial assistance for those who would be evicted from properties reclaimed by returnees to reduce secondary displacement and promote social cohesion.\\n\\n### Refugees International calls on the Biden Administration and Members of Congress to:\\n\\n**Implement Targeted Sanctions Waivers for Early Recovery Operations**\\n\\nU.S. Congress and the Biden administration should implement targeted Caesar Sanctions waivers and a new General License (GL), [similar to Syria GL 23 which authorized transactions for earthquake relief](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1261), to enable early recovery operations to stabilize conditions in Syria, especially in areas where early returns will be concentrated. Preparing Syrian communities to absorb returning refugees is crucial, but this will require greater flexibility to INGOs and vetted Syrian NGOs, like the White Helmets, to conduct early recovery operations in Syria. Targeted waivers would enable humanitarian actors to address critical needs including rebuilding infrastructure, repairing homes, restoring essential services, and supporting livelihoods without fear of violating sanctions. Targeted waivers will enable recovery efforts that directly benefit civilians and contribute to long-term stability.\\n\\n### Refugees International calls on international justice mechanisms to:\\n\\n**Document Mass Atrocities and Ensure Accountability**\\n\\nInternational researchers and justice institutions should begin working with Syrian civil society on documenting mass atrocities. This is a critical moment for UN international justice mechanisms, including the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism and the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria, to act decisively to access new evidence of Assad-era atrocities and the long list of missing or forcibly disappeared persons. Collaboration between justice organizations and Syrian-led NGOs is essential to document the experiences of released detainees and to investigate the fate of forcibly disappeared individuals. Interim Syrian authorities should facilitate access to prison and government records to advance accountability efforts.', original_date='2024-12-16T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='UN Syria Commission calls for protection of civilians, humane treatment of ex-combatants and the safeguarding of evidence of crimes [EN/AR]', body='**GENEVA (16 December 2024)** – All parties to the conflict in Syria must protect civilians, treat those who have laid down their arms humanely, and safeguard evidence of crimes to help ensure future accountability, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said today. As the caretaker Government solidifies its control and conflict rages in northern Syria, the Commission stressed that all parties must fully comply with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.\\n\\n\"The caretaker Government in Damascus as well as other parties in the Syrian conflict should ensure that their forces are abiding by their stated commitments to prevent violence and protect civilians, in particular the most vulnerable communities,” said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the relief felt by Syrians when prisoners are freed from the former government’s abominable detention facilities cannot be overstated. The Commission has investigated and reported on disappearances and violations in Syrian detention facilities since 2011. The Commission has [found](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/iici-syria/detention-report) that the former government has committed the crimes against humanity of extermination, murder, rape or other forms of sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance and other inhuman acts. Based on the same conduct, war crimes have also been committed.\\n\\nThe Commission stresses the critical importance of safeguarding all evidence and crime scenes, including mass grave sites, for forensic documentation and analysis. The caretaker government should ensure that all arrest and detention files are protected and preserved at the sites where they were found in a manner that ensures their utility in future accountability processes. Further, the Commission calls on the authorities to issue appropriate proclamations at the highest level requiring the public to refrain from disturbing such sites, while reiterating that justice and accountability processes will follow.\\n\\n\"For all those Syrians who do not find their loved ones among the freed, this evidence may be their best hope to uncover the truth about their missing relatives - alongside the testimonies of their fellow detainees who survived the most dreadful suffering and who have just been released,\" said Commissioner Lynn Welchman. “They have a right to the truth, and the evidence must not be destroyed or tampered with.”\\n\\nIn light of the declaration of intent to hold perpetrators accountable, the Commission reiterates that any such trials must be public, transparent and undertaken with full respect for fair trial rights.\\n\\n“Syrians deserve justice after near 14 years of brutal war, where almost every crime listed in the Rome Statute has been committed. Perpetrators should be brought to justice, especially those most responsible, and Syrians must be in the lead in shaping the justice and accountability response. The international community must be ready to support them,” said Commissioner Hanny Megally. “Full justice for victims and survivors will undoubtedly need to be broader than trials and they should be allowed to pursue their demands for truth, reparations and legal and institutional reforms.”\\n\\nFighting has continued in the northern, eastern, and northeastern parts of the country, while Israeli forces have advanced beyond the zone established by the May 1974 Agreement on Disengagement for the first time in 50 years and reportedly carried out more than 500 airstrikes. As the UN Secretary-General has stated, these are “extensive violations of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\\n\\nUnited States forces have also conducted dozens of airstrikes on alleged Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) targets since 8 December, while reported airstrikes by Türkiye continued against targets linked to US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast.\\n\\nMore than 1 million people have been displaced by hostilities since 27 November as the HTS-led coalition swept across the area controlled by the former Government, and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army took over territory from the Kurdish-led SDF in the north.\\n\\nIn the midst of these historic days, the Commission once again renews its call for a nationwide ceasefire concerning all warring parties, including all States.\\n\\nHumanitarian capacity to support those newly displaced, as well as those returning, is overstretched and urgently requires support. The Commission calls on Member States to rapidly meet this challenge and ensure that aid is made available without delay to support the 17 million Syrians in need.\\n\\nIt further reiterates its calls for urgent review or suspension of sanctions regimes to ensure they are not impeding such support. “As we have seen, sanctions cause disproportionate harm to the poor and most vulnerable, and now is the time to give Syrians the chance to rebuild their own country,” concluded Commission Chair Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro.\\n\\nENDS\\n\\n***Background**: The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established on 22 August 2011 by the Human Rights Council through resolution* [*S-17/1*](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/ResS17_1.pdf)*.The mandate of the Commission is to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Human Rights Council also tasked the Commission with establishing the facts and circumstances that may amount to such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to identify those responsible with a view of ensuring that perpetrators of violations, including those that may constitute crimes against humanity, are held accountable. The Human Rights Council has repeatedly extended the Commission\\'s mandate since then, most recently until 31 March 2025.*\\n\\n***More information** on the work of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria can be found* [*here*](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/iici-syria/independent-international-commission)*.*\\n\\n***For media requests, please contact:** Johan Eriksson, UN Syria Commission of Inquiry Media Adviser, at +41 76 691 0411 / johan.eriksson@un.org; or Todd Pitman, Media Adviser, Investigative Missions, at +41766911761 / todd.pitman@un.org; Pascal Sim, Human Rights Council Media Officer, at +41229179763 / simp@un.org.*', original_date='2024-12-16T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

It was established by the United Nations’ General Assembly in response to the urgent calls from family members of Syria’s many thousands of missing persons to determine their fate and whereabouts. The IIMP takes a victim-centered approach, is inclusive of families and is guided by the principle of ‘do no harm’. These principles are of paramount importance in dealing with the rapidly changing context.\\n\\nAt this critical juncture, it is essential to ensure the protection and preservation of information, data, and sites of vital relevance to clarifying the fate and whereabouts of missing persons. All parties to the conflict in Syria are required to fully cooperate with the IIMP, as set out in UNGA resolution 77/301 and in line with their obligations under international law. Authorities in Syria are expected to take all necessary measures to facilitate the work of the IIMP. They must also preserve and protect records and information which may be valuable to families knowing what happened to their missing relatives and take measures to protect mass graves throughout the country.\\n\\nWhile the past few days have reignited families’ hope in reuniting with their loved ones, many have been severely impacted by rumors and inaccurate reports. The IIMP urges all actors, including media outlets, to refrain from circulating unverified information, or any information detrimental to families’ wellbeing and survivors’ dignity. Moreover, assistance to survivors and families is of utmost importance – the IIMP is committed to working jointly with other actors towards an effective response in light of the massive needs.\\n\\nMuch work lies ahead to clarify the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons in Syria. The IIMP will work towards this end, including with relevant stakeholders. It is also receiving relevant information, including primary source data, on archives, records, and lists from detention centers, prisons, courts, cemeteries, coroners, and information about potential or known burial sites.

Reception sites, including schools, mosques, and public buildings, are nearing full capacity, leaving displaced populations facing significant health and safety risks, psychological distress, and barriers to accessing critical support.\\n\\n**Tanya Evans, IRC\\'s Country Director in Syria, said:**\\n\\n*\"The situation in the northeast of the country is dire, yet we continue to respond to those who were already in need of assistance and those newly displaced. Our teams are working tirelessly, preparing cash distributions to populations in need. At Tabqa School, which is being used as an emergency shelter, we will be distributing 2,400 hygiene kits to families seeking safety there and have also deployed three Mobile Medical Units to Raqqa and Tabqa to deliver essential healthcare.*\\n\\n*\"In the northwest, we have been able to resume work at key program sites and recently regained access to the Idlib National Hospital after airstrikes in the hospital’s vicinity forced us to suspend activities earlier in the month. This hospital is a lifeline for the community, and we’re focused on getting it back to full capacity through critical rehabilitation work after it was damaged by airstrikes at the end of November.*\\n\\n*\"As towns and villages become accessible for the first time in many years, particularly in areas that used to be near the frontline, the IRC is rapidly working to assess the needs of populations who have been largely cut off from assistance. A system-wide scale up of humanitarian and early recovery activities is now urgently required across the country, and with it an urgent need for increased funding to empower organizations on the ground to respond effectively to the growing crisis.”*\\n\\nWith hostilities continuing to impact the ability of humanitarian organizations to support vulnerable communities, the IRC reiterates its call on all parties to commit to a sustained and lasting peace in Syria. We urge immediate action to protect civilians and critical infrastructure, ensure the safety of humanitarian workers, and guarantee unimpeded access to life-saving assistance.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n## **Media contacts**\\n\\nChiara Trincia\\n\\nInternational Rescue Committee\\n\\n**Chiara.Trincia@rescue.org**\\n\\nJames Sussman\\n\\n**James.Sussman@rescue.org**\\n\\nNancy Dent\\n\\nInternational Rescue Committee\\n\\n**Nancy.Dent@rescue-uk.org**\\n\\nIRC Global Communications\\n\\n+1 646 761 0307\\n\\n**communications@rescue.org**', original_date='2024-12-15T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

So, we need to get this right from the very beginning.\\n\\nSo, and you know, I've been saying all along that we need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians. That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves, it's a Syrian responsibility with the help and assistance hopefully.\\n\\nLet me just continue then the second challenge, that of course as I know that the caretaker government is very well aware of, is to get the state institutions up and functioning. You know, obviously, just service delivery, and law and order, and security extremely important.\\n\\nThen of course we all know that Syria has been through an enormous also humanitarian crisis. So, we need to make sure that Syria receives increased immediate humanitarian assistance to the people in Syria, and to all the refugees who want to return.

Tens of thousands of people are passing through heavily mined areas on a daily basis causing unnecessary fatal accidents. The fighting forces have melted away from the front lines, leaving vast areas littered with explosives.***\\n\\n***“Returning Syrians simply don’t know where the landmines are lying in wait. They are scattered across fields, villages and towns, so people are horribly vulnerable. But with funding for only forty deminers, HALO is desperately understaffed.

Clearing the debris of war is fundamental to getting the country back on its feet.”***\\n\\nThis heat [map](https://halotrust.canto.global/s/GE752?viewIndex=0) is HALO’s best estimate of the likely hotspots for deadly landmines and other explosive ordnance across Syria.\\n\\nSwathes of Syria are covered with cluster munitions, missiles, landmines, grenades and other deadly explosive ordnance, following 14 years of protracted civil war. For the last four years Syria has had more victims of landmines and explosive debris than any other country\\n\\nand is ranked as one of the most dangerous places in the world. To date, there has been no nationwide survey of the front lines and locations of minefields.\\n\\nHALO is operating an emergency hotline in the northwest of the country, near the border with Turkey, where people can report finding discarded landmines and other suspicious explosive objects that might kill or maim them. Emergency HALO demining experts then neutralise the items.\\n\\nMouiad Alnofoly, HALO Syria Operations Manager, said: ***“In the past week, as people have tried returning to their homes and farmland, we have had a ten-fold increase in calls to the hotline. The phone is ringing non-stop.***\\n\\n***“Some of the callers are refugees coming back to Syria. Others are people who were displaced inside the country and are now making their way back home. But they’re all in mortal danger if they take the wrong pathway. None of them know where the landmines are hidden.”***\\n\\nO’Brien and Alnofoly said their immediate priorities were to offer advice about the risks of landmines to aid agencies helping war-displaced people - and then to start the work of clearing the explosives.\\n\\n***“The HALO Trust has over 35 years’ experience making landmines and other explosives safe. The challenge in Syria is the sheer size of the problem. We could easily employ 100 deminers right now, just in the area where we have already been working for the past few years.

       " ReliefArticle(title='UNHCR urges more support for Syria and safety for aid workers as humanitarian activities slowly resume', body=\"*This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR Representative in Syria, Gonzalo Vargas Llosa – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.*\\n\\nOver the past 14 years of conflict and crisis, more than 13 million Syrians were forced from their homes. During this time, UNHCR and its partners have been and continue to be on the ground in Syria, delivering life-saving assistance wherever the situation allows.\\n\\nFigures are not yet available, but thousands of Syrian refugees have started returning to the country from Lebanon via the official Masnaa border point and other unofficial border crossings. At the same time, other Syrians have fled in the opposite direction into Lebanon.\\n\\nRefugees are also returning from Türkiye through the Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salam border crossings to north-west Syria. UNHCR had to temporarily suspend some activities at the border, but now our presence is resuming. Yesterday, we had about 2,000 returns of Syrians from the main border with Lebanon. There were Syrians going back to Idlib, to rural Damascus, to Damascus, to Daraa, to Aleppo, and to other locations.\\n\\nThousands also left Syria and crossed into Lebanon. So, there is a two-way movement. One of the main challenges is that there are no immigration authorities on the Syrian side. The immigration officials who were operating there during the previous regime, all left their positions. And the new transitional authorities have not been able yet to establish immigration procedures, which creates, of course, some challenges and difficulties.\\n\\nAlso, we are seeing some returns from Türkiye. We expect that figure to grow.\\n\\nAs we have stated before, there are clearly a lot of Syrians who are in a wait-and-see attitude.\\n\\nIn Syria, most of our activities during the intense period of fighting were suspended but, fortunately, in the past 72 hours we have been able to resume through our local partners quite a lot of our activities in those areas which are now more secure. Just to give you an example, UNHCR supports 114 community centres all over Syria, which provide a whole range of services to destitute Syrians and to the internally displaced, but also to those who are coming back. We have been able, as of yesterday, to reactivate 75 per cent of those community centres. In the past couple of days, a UN team from Damascus, including myself, visited Aleppo and Homs, and we were able to see the resumption of some of those activities, in addition to meeting with our colleagues in both locations, who went through some very harrowing days during the intense fighting. We were also able to have some contact with the interim authorities.\\n\\nIt is, of course, very early days, but those interactions are beginning. In general, the initial signals that the interim authorities are sending us are constructive. They say that they want us to stay in Syria and that they appreciate the work that we have been doing now for many years. They need us to continue doing that work and, most importantly for us, they will provide us with the necessary security to carry out those activities.\\n\\nIn general, the security is getting better, although the situation in the Northeast is different. As an illustration, the UN interagency team that travelled to Aleppo and Homs – we travelled more than 800 kilometres in a period of less than two days, and we encountered almost no checkpoints.\\n\\nTo anybody who has been in Syria, they will know that checkpoints were a critical feature of the previous regime and I think that there is a sense among some that this is a very positive development. On the roads, as we travelled, there were Syrians moving from one location to another without the type of constant checkpoints that we saw during the previous regime. Of course, we will need to see whether that type of freedom of movement we are witnessing at the moment will continue.\\n\\nOn the issue of the vacuum of law and order, there have been some lootings, including of UN property, over the past week. We have been reassured by the interim authorities that they want to address this gap as soon as possible and that they are trying to do everything possible to restore law and order. But they have also asked for a little bit of patience on our side as they complete this very important task of guaranteeing security, not only for their own citizens, but also for UN partners.\\n\\nA final note on funding. The interagency flash appeal that was launched in October requested $324 million for activities up to March of next year. At the moment, between contributions and projections, the total raised is $88 million. So, there is an urgent need for additional financial support.\\n\\nYears of conflict have devastated Syria’s economy and infrastructure, leaving 90 per cent of the population relying on some form of humanitarian aid.

More than one in five people are being displaced for at least the second time. Significant and growing return movements have also begun to be reported since 7 December.\\n\\nMany internally displaced persons (IDPs) have arrived in cities and towns near conflictaffected areas, where reception centres and shelters have been established. Reception centers are overcrowded, and resources are limited, making it difficult to meet the needs of all displaced persons. Nevertheless, emergency aid, including tents, blankets, and food, has been distributed. Protection services, including support for women and children, and health services like nutrition screenings and medical consultations, are being provided. Efforts are underway to improve sanitation and hygiene facilities in shelters and reception centers to prevent diseases outbreak and ensure basic living standards for IDPs. There is an urgent need for more shelter, food, non-food items, and sanitation facilities. Expanding protection services and health support, particularly for vulnerable groups, is also critical.\\n\\nConflict and insecurity have disrupted critical transportation routes, limiting the movement of people and goods, and also affecting the delivery of aid. Some looting of civilian properties and factories, as well as warehouses holding humanitarian supplies has been reported.\\n\\nThe unofficial exchange rate hit a record high, reaching SYP25000/$1 in Damascus and SYP41,000/$1 in Aleppo.

This includes 155,000 people experiencing secondary displacement. The majority of those displaced are women and children, with women and girls comprising nearly 50 percent of those forced to flee their homes. The most affected governorates are Aleppo, with 542,600 displaced people, followed by Hama (347,100) and Homs (26,000).\\n\\nSince the fall of the Government in Damascus on 8 December, clashes have been reported in Manbij (Aleppo Governorate) and Deir-ez-Zor, with less fighting reported in other areas. Conflict has damaged civilian infrastructure and humanitarian assets, and disrupted services, in northeast Syria. Around 185 schools in Raqqa, Al-Hasaka, and Tabqa have been repurposed as shelters for IDPs, disrupting education for nearly 185,000 students. Healthcare services are under strain, with hospitals like Ar-Raqqa National and Maternity Hospitals preparing for increased patient loads due to the influx of displaced individuals. WASH services are also impacted, with efforts underway to provide WASH facilities in collective centers. Additionally, the displacement has overwhelmed transit sites, highlighting the urgent need for winterization supplies, communal cooking facilities, and core relief items to support vulnerable populations. Hostilities along the road between Qamishli and Damascus have been hindering population movement and the transportation of humanitarian shipments.\\n\\nThis has made it difficult to deliver essential aid to affected areas. Additionally, the capacity of reception centers in cities like Ar-Raqqa and Tabqa is limited, and these shelters, often converted sports centers and schools, are overcrowded with displaced people.

Early in the week, we opened hotlines for released detainees and family members who sought to be reunited.\\n\\nDrawing on the ICRC's long experience, we immediately offered to help all parties exercising authority in Syria to locate the missing.

We want truth and justice so that the souls of all those killed may rest in peace, their memory may be immortalised, and to ensure that there is no recurrence,” said a survivor from Syria’s Sednaya prison. “As a former detainee who was tortured for his opinion, I hope that in the future justice will prevail in Syria and that Syrians will not fear their government.”\\n\\nAs organisations already supporting Syrian survivors, we call on all our members, partners and other stakeholders to join us in prioritising comprehensive and long-term support for Syrian civil society. This will serve as the backbone for reconstruction efforts, and pave the way for healing and justice processes to be set in motion.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Syrian Network for Human Rights verified the names of nearly 15,000 Syrians tortured to death at the hands of Assad’s officials over the previous ten years. In 2022, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that more than 100,000 people had died in Syrian prisons in that time. The real toll will only be known after mass graves and documents from the detention centres are examined and authenticated by trained experts. This documentation must be preserved from destruction.\\n\\nAs Syria emerges from 53 years of dictatorship, bereaved families and all those who suffered torture at the hands of the Assad regime must be given the opportunity to play a central role in seeking justice and accountability for the crimes against humanity committed against them. While a limited number of universal jurisdiction prosecutions against Syrian officials have been undertaken by Germany, France and other EU states, and some convictions secured, a broader collective effort will be necessary to achieve meaningful accountability for the people of Syria.\\n\\nOur experience in supporting survivors of torture and other ill-treatment show us that healing and justice are often mutually re-enforcing. As the Convention Against Torture established, all survivors of torture have the right to redress for the crime that has been committed against them, which includes amongst other forms of reparations, “the means for as full rehabilitation as possible”.\\n\\nThousands of survivors released from prisons this past week will need medical care, emergency psychological support, and support to re-establish, wherever possible, their own livelihoods. They are returning to a country in a deep economic crisis, with many urgent and competing needs.\\n\\nMany survivors were subjected to sexual torture, a topic still stigmatised in families and communities across Syria. Addressing stigma and shifting the perceived shame to the real shame\\n\\nof the perpetrators will require thoughtful intervention at the community level, and continuous support.\\n\\nBeyond the immediate needs of survivors, five decades of torture and 13 years of uprising and civil war have inflicted very deep trauma across the entire society. Many survivors of Assad’s regime have physical and psychological wounds that will last a lifetime, and which can negatively impact future generations. Left untreated, mental health conditions can worsen and result in serious impairments, leading to family breakdown. Through appropriate and effective support, counselling and therapy, the impact of mental health conditions can be contained and reduced. Mental health services and professionals are critically needed in Syria.\\n\\nSyrian organisations must be at the forefront of the response to the needs for healing and justice in their new country.

More than half of the country’s hospitals and primary care centers were destroyed or significantly damaged, while the majority of healthcare providers fled the country in search of safety. Factors such as malnutrition, winter exposure, and limited access to medical care and treatments contributed to excess deaths.\\n\\nHumanitarian aid channels into Syria have long been fraught with challenges due to shifting military control, international diplomacy, and fluctuations in funding and supply chains. Nonetheless, Direct Relief has maintained close partnerships with partners working on the ground in Syria and a steady flow of funding and material medical aid into the country, even at moments when other aid was scarce. In the past six months alone, Direct Relief has provided 13 shipments of material medical aid, valued at more than $48 million, to Syrian medical partners.\\n\\nIn addition, 11 Direct Relief shipments to the Syrian American Medical Society, MedGlobal Syria, the Independent Doctors Association, and Syria Relief & Development are currently in process, including two shipments in Turkey awaiting last-mile transport. These shipments contain emergency medications and supplies, chronic disease medications, Midwife Kits, hygiene items, and other requested support.\\n\\nDirect Relief’s established humanitarian channels remain operational, allowing aid to continue flowing. Although the organization’s emergency response team is still working to glean a larger sense of the logistics and need on the ground, partners in Syria are sending in specialized teams to assess healthcare facilities, prisons, and medical needs of the general public.\\n\\nAn ambulance and referral system in northwest Syria, run by Syria Relief & Development and supported by Direct Relief, has been actively responding to increasing hostilities over the past several days. The system, which includes eight ambulances and 10 patient transportation vehicles, connects patients to more than 100 healthcare facilities across Syria’s northwest. Over the past year, Direct Relief has provided more than $3 million in funding and 49 tons of medical material aid to this area of the country.\\n\\nLarge-scale population movement in the aftermath of the war, and new assessments of previously inaccessible areas, are likely to contribute to a changing picture of geographic distribution and health needs in the coming days and weeks. Syrian partners have communicated that high priorities include reestablishing public health facilities and providing medical first aid and emergency psychosocial support.\\n\\nBecause the Syrian war was so long-lasting, healthcare nonprofits working on the ground have focused additional efforts to improve specialty care and build resilient, up-to-date medical and training facilities, even against a backdrop of conflict. Direct Relief has long supported these efforts, providing material aid and funding for oncology, maternal health, and a simulation lab used for medical training, among other projects, in addition to the organization’s large-scale support for primary and emergent medical care.\\n\\nDirect Relief is in close communication with partners on the ground to evaluate immediate medical needs and long-term strategy. The organization remains committed to supporting health care in Syria, and will continue to respond as needed.\\n\\n*Alexandra Kelleher, Holland Bool, and Dan Hovey provided reporting for this update.*', original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='Three things to know about what’s happening in Syria', body='[Syria ](https://www.msf.org/syria)has been severely impacted by 13 years of [war](https://www.msf.org/war-and-conflict), causing hardship for people and economic instability. Over 14 million Syrians have been displaced by the war, and in 2024, 16.7 million require humanitarian aid. Recent political developments have led to the fall of the government in Syria, and the situation is changing quickly. Teams from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are working in northeast and northwest Syria. Here’s what to know about what we’re seeing and how we’re responding.\\n\\n## 1. Millions of people in northwest Syria are displaced as winter is setting in\\n\\nIn northwest Syria, there are 5.1 million people, including 3.4 million internally displaced, mostly women and children. After 12 years of civil war, conditions across the region, including in displacement camps, remain dire. Recent developments in northern regions like Aleppo have displaced thousands more and the winter conditions will make things worse.\\n\\nPeople are also returning to their homes, but many are only temporarily leaving displacement camps. People come back to the camps for many reasons, including because people are finding that their houses are destroyed, especially in rural areas of Idlib and Aleppo. They are waiting for their homes to be rebuilt by authorities and organisations.\\n\\nOther obstacles to people staying in their homes include the lack of essential services like water, electricity, and medical care, and because of schooling or financial constraints or because they are waiting for better conditions.\\n\\n## 2. Violence in the northwest has pushed people to the northeast\\n\\nThe escalation in northwest Syria began when opposition factions (Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham) launched a military operation towards Aleppo and its surrounding countryside. As the conflict intensified in the first days of the operations, opposition factions (Syrian National Army) targeted Tal Rifaat, a town full of camps hosting people displaced from nearby Afrin.\\n\\nAfter several days of fierce fighting, the opposition seized control of Tal Rifaat, triggering around 80,000 people to leave, marking the second time they were displaced. [These people have now crossed into northeastern Syria](https://www.msf.org/msf-responds-peoples-developing-needs-northeast-syria), arriving in Tabqa, Raqqa, and Hassakeh, an already fragile region facing significant humanitarian challenges. These include a healthcare system that is almost totally reliant on international support and funding, which has been continuously cut in recent years.\\n\\nMeanwhile, clashes have now spread to Manbij, west of Raqqa, further threatening the region with another wave of displacement and increasing instability.\\n\\n## 3. MSF is responding across the north, while trying to assess other areas\\n\\nMSF teams are working across northern Syria responding to needs. In the northwest, we continue to provide people with medical care through our existing mobile clinics, health facilities, and hospitals. Since the end of November, we have donated trauma and surgical equipment to hospitals across the northwest. We’ve also provided hundreds of families with hygiene kits, mattresses, and blankets.\\n\\nIn northeastern Syria, we continue to provide general healthcare, treatment for non-communicable diseases and malnutrition, and mental health support. We also provide medical care and water in Al-Hol camp. In recent weeks, we have distributed more than 10,000 bottles of water, 200 large tents, infant formula packs and diapers, blankets, and mattresses to those in immediate need in Tabqa, where we have also started a mobile clinic. MSF teams in Tabqa, Raqqa, and Hassakeh are also addressing water and sanitation needs.\\n\\nMSF did not have access to areas that were under the control of the former government of Syria. We are now negotiating with the new authorities in Damascus to secure access to areas under the control of the new government. Our teams are in touch with health organisations and partners to assess the needs in other parts of Syria, and see the possibilities to work in new locations, to increase our medical and humanitarian support to people in Syria.', original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Al final del día, los 24 años de gobierno del presidente Bashar al Assad se habían derrumbado, dejando a Siria en una encrucijada.\\n\\nEn los últimos 14 años de conflicto y crisis, cientos de miles de personas sirias han sido asesinadas o heridas y más de 13 millones se han visto forzadas a abandonar sus hogares, la mitad de la población que había antes de la guerra. Más de 7 millones de personas sirias están desplazadas dentro del país y más de 6 millones viven como refugiadas, principalmente en países vecinos como Türkiye, Líbano y Jordania, pero también en Europa y otros países del mundo.\\n\\nMuchas personas refugiadas se preguntan ahora qué supondrán para ellas los acontecimientos de los últimos días. Aunque la situación sigue evolucionando rápidamente y quedan muchas preguntas por responder, esto es lo que sabemos.\\n\\n## **Un millón de nuevas personas desplazadas**\\n\\nDesde el inicio de la ofensiva el 27 de noviembre, aproximadamente un millón de personas se han visto desplazadas de zonas como las provincias de Alepo, Hama, Homs e Idlib. Para más de una de cada cinco personas, éste era al menos el segundo desplazamiento.\\n\\nAdemás, entre finales de septiembre y finales de noviembre, Siria recibió a más de medio millón de personas que huían de los ataques aéreos israelíes en el vecino Líbano. Alrededor del 60 por ciento eran sirios que regresaban, mientras que el resto eran libaneses.

[EN/AR]', body=\"After 14 years of conflict, recent developments in Syria have raised hopes that the world’s largest forced displacement crisis may finally be resolved, but the future remains uncertain.\\n\\nBy UNHCR staff\\n\\nAn offensive by armed opposition groups that began in northwest Syria on 27 November and quickly spread to other parts of the country, reached the capital, Damascus, early on Sunday morning. By the end of the day, President Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule had collapsed, leaving Syria at a crossroads.\\n\\nOver the past 14 years of conflict and crisis, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed or injured and more than 13 million have been forced from their homes – half the pre-war population. Over 7 million Syrians are displaced inside the country while more than 6 million are living as refugees, mainly in neighbouring countries including Türkiye, Lebanon and Jordan, but also in Europe and other countries around the world.\\n\\nMany refugees are now wondering what the events of recent days will mean for them. While the situation is still evolving rapidly and many questions remain, this is what we know.\\n\\n## **1 million people newly displaced**\\n\\nSince the start of the offensive on 27 November, approximately 1 million people have been newly displaced from areas including Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Idlib governorates. For more than one in five, this was at least the second time they had been displaced.\\n\\nIn addition, between late September and late November, Syria received more than half a million people fleeing Israeli airstrikes in neighbouring Lebanon. About 60 per cent were returning Syrians, while the rest were Lebanese. Since a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon went into effect on 27 November, some 40,000 Lebanese refugees have returned to their country.\\n\\n## **Thousands returning, others fleeing**\\n\\nFigures are not yet available, but thousands of Syrian refugees have reportedly started returning to the country from Lebanon via the official Masnaa border point and other unofficial border crossings. At the same time, some Syrians have fled in the opposite direction into Lebanon.\\n\\nRefugees are also returning from Türkiye through the Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salam border crossings to north-west Syria.\\n\\n## **Most refugees opt to wait and see**\\n\\nMillions more Syrian refugees are still trying to understand what the dramatic events of the last two weeks mean for them and their families. They are following developments closely to assess whether the transition of power will be a peaceful one that respects their rights and allows for a safe return.\\n\\n“There is a remarkable opportunity for Syria to move toward peace and for its people to begin returning home,” [said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi on Monday](https://www.unhcr.org/news/speeches-and-statements/statement-syria-un-high-commissioner-refugees-filippo-grandi). “But with the situation still uncertain, millions of refugees are carefully assessing how safe it is to do so.”\\n\\nGrandi added that refugees must be able to make informed decisions and that developments need to evolve peacefully for “voluntary, safe and sustainable returns to finally occur”. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, stands ready to support refugees returning to Syria, as conditions allow, but given the current uncertainty, refugees will continue to need protection in host countries and time to make informed decisions on whether to return home without undue pressure.\\n\\n**“It's all very new and uncertain, but we want to start life from scratch in Syria.”**\\n\\nMariam Fendi and her husband, Nader, fled Homs in 2017 with their five children and have been living in a tented settlement in Saadnayel, Lebanon, ever since.

They should still be granted the same rights as other asylum-seekers while they wait for decision-making on their applications to resume.\\n\\nOnce conditions in Syria are clearer, UNHCR will also provide detailed guidance on the international protection needs of Syrians that will help States in processing applications.\\n\\n## **Humanitarian crisis**\\n\\nAfter more than a decade in exile, many refugees no longer have homes or jobs to return to in Syria.

       " ReliefArticle(title='Statement from the Syrian NGO Alliance SNA on the recent changes in Syria, 12 December 2024 [EN/AR]', body=\"Syrians from all walks of life and across the globe are closely following the recent changes in their homeland. Syria, which on the morning of Sunday, December 2024, 8, marked the end of more than six decades of oppression and tyranny. This era witnessed the elimination of a genuine and free civic space, the marginalization of society, and the deprivation of human rights.\\n\\nThe organizations operating under the umbrella of the Syrian Non-Governmental Organizations Alliance (SNA) are Syrian in origin and ideology. Over the past years, we have worked across all Syrian territories, either openly or secretly, to provide humanitarian aid in accordance with humanitarian principles. The staff of our organizations have made great sacrifices, with many of our colleagues losing their lives while fulfilling their responsibilities to support the communities we exist to serve.\\n\\nThe declared presence of an alliance of non-governmental organizations in northwest Syria is a direct result of forced displacement, changes in control zones, and the inability of these institutions to obtain licenses or operate in Damascus, due mostly to the bureaucratic repression imposed by the now-former regime. These factors, coupled with the imposition of numerous legal, operational, and financial obstacles, led to the displacement of countless humanitarian workers. These workers, alongside their communities, moved to northern Syria, where they found refuge. Through these efforts, they established exemplary models of professional humanitarian work that prioritize the community, leverage its capabilities, and adhere to humanitarian principles.\\n\\nWe, the Syrian Non-Governmental Organizations Alliance, congratulate the great Syrian people on achieving their rights, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose anniversary we commemorate this week. We congratulate these great people, whom we have honor of serving, on reaching a historic milestone where they can rebuild their country, claim their rights, and defend them. As displaced people return to their communities or origin, they face a reality where services are already heavily strained, due to successive economic and health crises, even prior to the dramatic increase in returnees. We would like to address the following key messages to international humanitarian actors, including the United Nations, its agencies, and humanitarian donors:\\n\\n1. **Acknowledgment of Donors:** We extend our gratitude to humanitarian donors for their enduring commitment over the past years and for their efforts to build the capacity of alliance organizations. This imposes a significant responsibility on us to transfer this experience to community leaders in Syria and to local organizations during the phase of early recovery and reconstruction that Syria will witness in the future.\\n2. **Reminder of the Nature of SNA Organizations:** We emphasize that SNA organizations operating in northwest Syria are Syrian organizations established through the relentless drive and determination of Syria’s great people. Due to the inability to obtain internationally accepted legal licensing within Syria, these organizations chose neighboring countries as operational hubs, benefiting from the availability of legal licensing conditions and mechanisms for financial transfers.\\n3. **Readiness and Expertise:** We affirm the readiness of all SNA members, with our accumulated expertise and more than a decade of experience, to meet the needs of the Syrian people across the entirety of Syrian territory.\\n4. **Call for Unified Coordination and Funding:** We urge all donors to maintain ongoing coordination mechanisms and to initiate immediate funding for direct response efforts for populations across all Syrian regions. For the first time since 2011, coordination can be unified for all of Syria, managed from within Syria, and driven by the efforts of local staff. This process will draw on the cumulative expertise of each coordination center under the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\\n5. **Governance of Humanitarian Work:** The SNA members are closely monitoring the governance of humanitarian work within Syria. We are prepared to transfer our operations to be based inside Syria as soon as an opportunity arises, provided that we can obtain legally recognized licenses from donor entities and secure access to Syrian bank accounts under the Central Bank of Syria’s system.\\n6. **Increased Financial Support for Recovery:** We call for explicit and increased financial support for Syria's recovery efforts to ensure sustainable development and long-term stability for the needy communities.\\n7. **Opposition to Forced Returns:** We call on all refugees' host countries governments to unconditionally oppose forced and involuntary returns of Syrians and to allow individual Syrians to determine for themselves when and if they wish to return to Syria.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** The civil space in Syria requires construction and activation with the involvement of all humanitarian actors. Our alliance of organizations will continue to enhance our role in Syrian civil society, maintaining our commitment to the Syrian citizen’s well-being. Our mission remains to ensure the presence of a free, dignified, and diverse Syrian civil society.\", original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Essential items such as rice, sugar and oil are in short supply and bread prices have spiked, making it critically important that we scale-up our efforts to assist during this winter season.\\n\\nWith rapidly escalating needs, WFP urgently requires $US250 million in the next six months to buy and deliver food assistance for up to 2.8 million displaced and vulnerable people. Flexible funding, in particular, would give WFP the agility to expand its operations as needed.\\n\\nWFP is well positioned in Syria to respond, as the agency has one of its largest country operations spanning seven offices that serve vulnerable communities across the country. This presence has enabled WFP to quickly scale-up over the past two weeks, providing daily ready-to-eat rations, food baskets, fresh and hot meals, to nearly 70,000 displaced people in hard-hit areas.

En medio del viaje, después de medianoche, había **un convoy de 400 coches** o más. Personas con linternas y uniformes militares nos detuvieron.

A better future for Syria requires addressing decades of abuse by the former government and other warring parties during the country’s 13-year conflict, ensuring accountability, and protecting Syrians regardless of their ethnic or sectarian backgrounds or political affiliations.\\n\\n“The Syrian people have endured more than a decade of brutal repression and conflict,” said [Lama Fakih](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/lama-fakih), Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “This is a critical moment to reject the horror show of the past, rebuild trust, and lay the groundwork for a society where everyone is treated with dignity.”\\n\\nStretching over more than 50 years, Baath Party rule in Syria accumulated an appalling record of human rights violations. The Syrian government under Bashar al-Assad committed countless atrocities, [crimes against humanity](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/10/15/targeting-life-idlib/syrian-and-russian-strikes-civilian-infrastructure), and other abuses during his 24-year presidency. These included widespread and systematic arbitrary arrests, [torture](https://reliefweb.int/node/1309266/), enforced disappearances, deaths in detention, use of chemical weapons, starvation as a weapon of war, and indiscriminate and targeted attacks against civilians and civilian objects.\\n\\nNon-state armed groups operating in Syria, including Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and factions of the Syrian National Army (SNA) who initiated the offensive on November 27, are also responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes.\\n\\nSyria’s new leadership has an unprecedented opportunity to lead by example on human rights, including by protecting basic rights in a new constitution. The new authorities should ratify and put into practice a host of international legal and human rights instruments and treaties that the Assad government did not, Human Rights Watch said.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch recommends urgent steps to all the authorities in control of areas of Syria:\\n\\n**Justice and Accountability for Past Abuses**\\n\\n- Secure and preserve evidence of atrocities. There is an urgent need to collect and safeguard evidence, including from mass grave sites and government records and archives, that could be vital evidence in future domestic and international accountability processes.\\n- Immediately invite to Syria, fully cooperate with, and ensure unhindered access to independent monitors including the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria (IIIM) and the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria.\\n- Ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and give it retroactive jurisdiction back to 2002 by filing a declaration with the court. The new authorities should also work to fully align Syria’s national legislation with the Rome Statute and international law.\\n\\n**Protection of Civilians, Minorities, and Cultural Heritage**\\n\\n- Protect civilians from violence and ensure their right to live in safety. Deploy security units when necessary to protect religious and ethnic minority groups that are perceived or suspected supporters of the former government.\\n- Take immediate steps to secure and guard weapons storage facilities in the areas under control of the interim authorities.\\n- Prioritize the clearance and destruction of landmines and explosive remnants of war, including facilitating the work of humanitarian agencies, training and equipping specialists, and ensuring that risk awareness and victim assistance efforts are adequately funded.\\n- Safeguard cultural and heritage sites, ensuring they are not looted or destroyed.\\n- Address the humanitarian and protection needs of displaced populations, including establishing processes and options for safe returns that meet international standards and protect the rights and dignity of all Syrians.\\n- Address the protection and safety needs of women, children, people with disabilities, older people, and other gropus most at risk of human rights abuses.\\n\\n**Addressing Detention and the Disappeared**\\n\\n- As thousands of prisoners, some of whom have languished in horrifying detention conditions for decades, are released from prisons and detention facilities across the country, authorities should take urgent steps to provide them with health care, psychosocial support, and rehabilitation; safeguard their dignity; and facilitate their swift reunions with their families.\\n- Establish a system to track and manage prisoner releases. Ensure fair, impartial justice for those suspected of crimes.\\n- Immediately ensure that anyone who is detained is only detained according to law and is brought before an independent judge or judicial panel at regular intervals to consider the legality and necessity of their detention with the power to order their release. Release all detainees who are not lawfully detained.\\n- Treat all detainees, including captured fighters and former members of the Assad government and security forces, humanely and in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards.\\n- Cooperate with the UN Independent Institution on Missing Persons (IIMP) to clarify what happened to the disappeared and give it full and unhindered access to Syria’s detention facilities.\\n\\n**Governance Reform**\\n\\n- Establish mechanisms to prevent looting of civilian properties, protect key infrastructure, and ensure the delivery of essential services such as water, electricity, and health care. Ensure essential services are accessible to people with disabilities. A transparent process to document and safeguard abandoned properties is critical to prevent further disputes and ensure their eventual reparation.\\n- Build a governance structure that represents all Syrians and ensure that decision-making processes are accessible, inclusive, and participatory. This means actively involving all sectors of Syrian society in shaping the country’s future, including women, people with disabilities, minority groups, civil society organizations, displaced communities, and political actors from diverse backgrounds.\\n- Establish systems for transparent consultations and equal representation to ensure that no group is excluded from contributing to Syria’s recovery and rebuilding.\\n- Allow prompt and unhindered access to humanitarian organizations and UN agencies to deliver impartial assistance to civilians in need, particularly in rural and remote areas.\\n- Improve cooperation with humanitarian organizations and the UN to ensure assistance is inclusive and fully accessible to people with disabilities.\\n\\n**Preventing Further Abuses by Armed Groups**\\n\\n- Publicly commit to upholding fundamental rights and freedoms for all, free from discrimination, including by guaranteeing freedom of movement, assembly, and expression.\\n- Refrain from arbitrary arrests or any other form of repression, including harassment and intimidation.\\n- Provide immediate access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to all detainees in the custody of HTS and the SNA and allow all detainees legal representation.\\n- Cooperate with local and international human rights organizations to document violations and ensure justice.\\n- Urgently review and amend penal and criminal procedure codes, as well as laws restricting association, expression, and political parties, bringing them into line with international human rights standards\\n- Urgently reform the judicial system and security services and ensure training for all staff on human rights standards.\\n\\nSyria’s new leadership should consider asking UN mechanisms and institutions to play a role in post-Assad Syria. The UN could deploy civilian police officers from various countries to Syria to help monitor and train local police and send human rights monitors to parts of the country that were considered loyal to Assad or where serious tensions may arise.\\n\\nThe international community, including the UN, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, China, and the League of Arab States, should ensure that aid to the present or future government, including election assistance, contributes to respecting human rights and creating conditions for free and fair elections.\\n\\nOther countries, UN institutions, and Syria’s emerging interim government should work with local authorities in northeast Syria to secure entry of critical humanitarian assistance to displaced people and to secure facilities there housing former Islamic State (ISIS) suspects and family members.\\n\\nThe US, UK, EU, and others should urgently consider lifting general or sectoral sanctions—such as on the purchase, sale, or export of goods and materials relating to or contributing to specific industries—as well as sanctions on Syrian financial institutions. Human Rights Watch has [documented](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/06/22/questions-and-answers-how-sanctions-affect-humanitarian-response-syria) the negative impact of these sanctions on humanitarian operations. HTS and others considered terrorist groups are subject to sanctions that prohibit making funds, assets, and economic resources available directly or indirectly to them.\\n\\nNeighboring countries and others that host sizable numbers of Syrian refugees should not rush to deport or otherwise expel Syrians from their territories and should maintain their temporary protection or refugee status. With Syria’s economic crisis persisting, infrastructure in shambles, and unstable security conditions, forcibly expelling refugees or pressuring to them to return at this juncture would risk compounding the humanitarian crisis and violating the international prohibition on nonrefoulement; that is, returning people to places where they would experience torture or other serious abuses. The priority should be creating conditions inside Syria that guarantee voluntary, safe, and dignified returns in line with international standards.\\n\\n“Years of failed or bloody transitions of power in the Middle East leave communities understandably fearful and skeptical of Syria’s new reality,” Fakih said. “Nevertheless, this moment presents an opportunity to prove that a different path is possible, one that prioritizes justice, accountability, and human rights. Syria’s new leadership can show the region and the world that a rights-respecting transition that secures the rights of all is possible.”', original_date='2024-12-12T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The value of the US dollar to the Syrian pound has multiplied by 300 times during the same period.\\n\\nBetween 2010 and 2022, Syria experienced a 16 percent decline in its Human Development Index, equating to a loss of 35 years of development.

President Bashar Al-Assad reportedly fled to Moscow, effectively ending his 24-year presidency. While the future governance of Syria remains uncertain, the forces in de facto control named Mohammed al-Bashir as interim prime minister.\\n\\nArmed opposition forces began advancing toward Damascus on 27 November, [seizing control of territory](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/atrocity-alert-no-420/) in Hama, Idlib and Aleppo governorates. Government forces subsequently launched counteroffensives, with airstrikes and shelling resulting in civilian casualties. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, fighting displaced more than 1 million people between 28 November and 10 December.\\n\\nHTS and other groups also freed prisoners from the infamous Sednaya Prison and other state-run detention facilities during their advance. Tens of thousands of people have been held in incommunicado detention in prisons and detention centers, with the UN Commission of Inquiry (CoI) on Syria reporting that more than 130,000 people have been arbitrarily detained, abducted or missing since the start of the conflict in 2011. Reflecting upon the prisoner release, Chair of the CoI Paulo Pinheiro remarked that the current environment in Damascus “is a scene that millions of Syrians could not have imagined a few days ago… It is incumbent on those now in charge to ensure that such atrocities are never again repeated.”\\n\\nAs the Syrian people work toward a peaceful political transition, populations still face many protection risks. Over the course of Syria’s nearly 14-year war the opposition had significantly splintered while other new armed groups emerged. Clashes continue in the northeast between the Syrian National Army, opposition groups and the Syrian Democratic Forces. HTS has reportedly committed to refrain from perpetrating reprisals against actual and perceived Assad supporters. While cautioning about the ongoing grave risks, UN Special Envoy on Syria Geir Pedersen acknowledged that so far “the HTS and other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people” of unity and inclusivity. Pederson also noted they were seeing “reassuring things on the ground” in Aleppo and Hama.\\n\\nAmid the fluid situation, the international community must encourage the de facto authorities to facilitate access to humanitarian and human rights actors. HTS and others freeing political prisoners should work closely with the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria and the CoI to ensure the documentation and preservation of evidence of the Assad government’s crimes. While thousands of Syrian refugees and asylum seekers who fled during the conflict are now attempting to return, the prospects for safe return for all those displaced by the conflict remain uncertain. States must uphold the principle of non-refoulement and respect the rights of asylum seekers to a voluntary, dignified and safe return.\\n\\n**HORRIFIC MASSACRE IN HAITI LEAVES OVER 100 DEAD**\\n\\nBetween 6 and 7 December an armed gang brutally murdered over 100 elderly men and women in [Haiti’s](https://www.globalr2p.org/countries/haiti/) Cité Soleil neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. While the exact number of people killed remains unclear, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk reported the death toll at 184 people, including 90 men and 37 women. Scores of residents aged over 60 were reportedly rounded up from their homes in the Wharf Jérémie section of Cité Soleil, and subsequently shot or stabbed to death with knives and machetes. Witnesses reported seeing bodies being burned while some individuals trying to save victims were also killed.\\n\\nThe National Human Rights Defence Network said local gang leader, Micanor Altès – also known as Wa Mikanò and Monel Felix – had targeted older people and Voodoo religious leaders to avenge his son’s death after a local Voodoo priest had accused the area’s residents of causing the child’s sickness with witchcraft. According to news sources, gang members have restricted movement in Wharf Jérémie, which the Haitian organization Cooperative for Peace and Development asserted is for the gang “to continue to identify (Voodoo) practitioners and the elderly with the aim of carrying out the silent killing.”\\n\\nThis latest massacre underscores Haitian authorities’ limited capacity to protect communities across Port-au-Prince, who are often confined to their neighborhoods and face indiscriminate violence, rape, torture, kidnappings and forced recruitment. Cité Soleil is a commune that has faced intense and unrelenting gang violence and turf wars for years, with Wharf Jérémie a strategic area in the port under Altès’ control and one of the most impenetrable gang strongholds.\\n\\nThe powerful gang coalition Viv Ansanm – which Altès is a member of – has launched coordinated attacks across the capital since late February, seeking to expand their territory beyond their strongholds. Attempts to overtake territory have resulted in deadly incidents as gangs increasingly target civilians, particularly in the past two months. In October Gran Grif carried out one of the largest assaults in decades, killing 115 civilians and injuring over 350 others in Pont-Sondé, Artibonite. In mid-November [violence flared](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/atrocity-alert-no-418/) across several neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, forcing several humanitarian organizations to suspend their life-saving activities. According to the UN, gang-related violence has killed 5,000 people this year and displaced more than 700,000 people, half of whom are children.\\n\\nThe international community, particularly the United States, must impose stricter measures to prevent the illicit supply, sale, diversion or transfer of small arms, light weapons and ammunitions into Haiti, which fuel violence and provide the means for perpetrating abuses. Stakeholders need to take urgent, concerted action to ensure the Haitian National Police and [UN-authorized Multinational Security Support Mission](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/atrocity-alert-no-412-lebanon-haiti-and-venezuela/) have the sufficient means to quell gang violence and bolster protection for vulnerable communities.\\n\\n**COMMEMORATING THE VICTIMS OF GENOCIDE**\\n\\nOn 9 December the international community marked the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime, as well as the 76th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The following day also marked the 76th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\\n\\nBoth the Genocide Convention and UDHR emerged in response to the horrors of World War II, particularly the Holocaust, and marked a historic commitment to prioritize human dignity over power politics. The Genocide Convention went beyond condemnation, establishing a legal and moral duty for states to prevent and punish genocide, while the UDHR laid the foundation for universal human rights protections. This year also holds particular significance as we approach the 20th anniversary of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) in 2025. R2P reaffirmed the international community’s commitment to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\\n\\nYet since the adoption of these landmark documents and the R2P principle, the state of multilateralism has shifted, leaving many of their aspirations and obligations unfulfilled. The international community has often failed to uphold universal human rights and prevent mass atrocities – from Cambodia, Rwanda and Srebrenica to Syria, [Myanmar](https://www.globalr2p.org/countries/myanmar-burma/), [China](https://www.globalr2p.org/countries/china/), [Sudan](https://www.globalr2p.org/countries/sudan/) and [Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory](https://www.globalr2p.org/countries/israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/) – countless populations have suffered grave injustices and unconscionable crimes. Nearly a year since the International Court of Justice issued provisional measures in South Africa’s case against Israel, affirming that all states have an obligation under the Genocide Convention to prevent acts that may lead to genocide, the world has yet to take meaningful action to prevent further atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\\n\\nSavita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “History shows that failure to act in the face of atrocities allows the unimaginable to become reality. We are at a critical threshold, witnessing a deliberate undermining of the collective commitment to fulfill the promise of ‘never again.’ If these commemorations are meant to honor the victims of past atrocities, we have an obligation to respect their memory by taking appropriate action when confronted by risks today.”\\n\\nAs the international community commemorates these anniversaries, UN member states must reaffirm their commitment to the foundational rights, protections and obligations enshrined in these historic documents and recentralize human rights and the rule of law as guiding principles for global governance. Achieving this requires urgent efforts to strengthen multilateral institutions, integrate atrocity prevention strategies into human rights mechanisms and respond decisively to early warning signs. States should also recognize the indispensable role of civil society and victim and survivor communities, whose advocacy and resilience have been critical in upholding the principles of the Genocide Convention and the UDHR. Governments must actively engage with these actors, amplify their voices and ensure their contributions inform policies and actions aimed at preventing atrocities.', original_date='2024-12-11T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Every citizen has the right to return to their home country, safe or not. But because one refugee chooses to repatriate is no justification to forcibly return another who remains fearful, as many Syrian refugees do, especially given the country’s unstable and possibly dangerous conditions.\\n\\nFollowing the [fall of Bashar al-Assad’s government](https://reliefweb.int/node/4116476/) in Syria over the weekend, some European governments have begun [announcing](https://www.reuters.com/world/european-countries-put-syrian-asylum-bids-hold-after-assads-fall-2024-12-09/) the suspension of individual status determinations for Syrians. But this approach carries real risks, especially given how keen some European states are to declare Syria safe and begin returns.\\n\\nThe 1951 Refugee Convention includes a “cessation clause” that says a person no longer needs international protection when the circumstances that caused them to become a refugee “have ceased to exist,” a phrase that indicates a high degree of certainty about the permanence and extent of change.

The rapidity of the change in Syria is inherently volatile. The situation on the ground is fragile and unpredictable, and the possibility of new waves of refugees fleeing persecution can’t be dismissed. Meanwhile, the situation in parts of the country is far from safe. Fierce fighting is ongoing in the north and northeast, and an estimated [125,000](https://reliefweb.int/node/4115490/) people, mostly Kurds, have been displaced since late November.\\n\\nAs UNHCR has noted, it is vital that Syrians in Europe retain access to asylum. No future returns of Syrians should take place until their claims are individually examined in full and fair procedures with due regard for past trauma and future fears.\\n\\nLikewise, notwithstanding a reluctance to keep hosting large numbers of refugees, Syria’s [neighbors](https://reliefweb.int/node/4057573/) Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan have provided temporary protection to the largest numbers of Syrians for many years. While these countries may wish to fast forward given the events in Syria, they should maintain such temporary protection until it’s clear that the changed circumstances in Syria are more than fleeting and will offer some stability.\\n\\nDonor countries should not falter in their support to these frontline states, even as they begin the pivot to aiding in the reconstruction of war-torn Syria to help make changes there both fundamental and durable.', original_date='2024-12-10T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Since he came to power, Bashar al-Assad directed a reign of terror on Syrian civilians that killed, tortured, persecuted, displaced, and disappeared countless victims and survivors. A defining tactic of Assad’s repression strategy was to target health care – to bomb hospitals, torture doctors, block medical aid, and deny health services. The Assad government’s widespread and systematic crimes [documented by PHR](https://phr.org/countries/syria/) and many others, demand justice and accountability. PHR is ready to support Syrians as they work to advance human rights, justice, and accountability. While this moment is also one of pain as the scale and scope of Assad’s violence comes to light, we hope to see a new dawn for the millions of Syrians who have suffered under Assad,” said [Houssam al-Nahhas, MD, MPH](https://phr.org/people/houssam-al-nahhas/), health and human rights researcher at PHR. Dr. al-Nahhas is a Syrian physician targeted by the government for providing health care.\\n\\n“Syrians are experiencing the fallout from the Assad regime collapse, including attacks and desperate searches for loved ones. The fate of the missing and disappeared must be a top priority for Syrian and international actors. While some political prisoners are being reunited with their families’ following years of detention, [early reports](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/middleeast/syria-saydnaya-prison-missing-intl-hnk/index.html) suggest that untold numbers of Syria’s disappeared and missing may have already been [killed](https://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/article/68531/) by the Assad government and human remains are already being found in secret prisons and mass graves around the country. It’s vital that survivors of this violence receive support and care while families of the victims are offered truth, closure, and redress,” said Dr. al-Nahhas. “We are ready to be a resource to all those who seek documentation, justice, and accountability in this new chapter for Syria.”\\n\\nThe swift collapse of the Syrian government ushers in a new era in the country. PHR calls for the transition and future governance to center and elevate fundamental human rights by supporting many survivors of torture and victims’ families. PHR also calls for unimpeded support to humanitarian efforts in the country, including urgent support for Syria’s health system following years of war and targeted attacks.\\n\\n“This is a critical juncture to collect and analyze evidence of violations perpetrated during Syria’s war, and to advance impartial and independent accountability mechanisms,” said Dr. Al-Nahhas. “PHR stands ready to mobilize documentation and lend its unique forensic, medical, scientific, and legal capacities to these efforts.”\\n\\nSince Syrian protestors took to the streets in March 2011, calling for freedom and social justice, PHR has documented the ensuing crackdown and suppression by the Syrian government. Over the past nearly 14 years of crisis in Syria, PHR has corroborated 608 attacks on health care facilities on a [detailed interactive map](https://syriamap.phr.org/). PHR determined that at least [548 of these attacks](https://syriamap.phr.org/#/en/findings) were perpetrated by the Syrian government and/or its Russian allies, while the remainder were perpetrated by non-state actors, international forces, or unknown actors. PHR also documented the killing of 949 health care providers with the Syrian government and its [allies](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/medical-personnel-are-targeted-in-syria/) responsible for 88 percent of the cases.\\n\\nPHR also conducted numerous research investigations into a wide range of human rights violations perpetrated during the war, from the [targeting of health workers for torture](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/my-only-crime-was-that-i-was-a-doctor/) to the [government’s obstruction of aid to opposition areas](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/syria-health-disparities/) to the [impacts of the conflict on women and girls](https://phr.org/our-work/resources/sexual-and-reproductive-health-in-northwest-syria/) to [in-depth investigations into specific attacks on hospitals](https://syriamap.phr.org/#/en/case-studies). PHR concluded that the Assad government executed a strategy of targeting health care to terrorize and destroy the resilience of its perceived enemies. These violations constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\n\\n“When you kill a nurse or bomb a clinic, the damage extends beyond the individual life extinguished or the facility walls pummeled. You demolish the social fabric and sense of safety that comes from being able to access health care. Bashar al-Assad targeted health care in this way, to devastating effect. To both commemorate the victims of Assad’s violations and the heroism of the health workers who survived these assaults, the global community should strengthen humanitarian aid to ensure that medical workers and humanitarians can do their jobs as Syria starts the long process of healing and recovery,” said al-Nahhas.\\n\\n*Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.* [*Learn more here.*](https://phr.org/about/)', original_date='2024-12-10T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

In this transitioning period, prioritizing children’s rights and needs is fundamental to sustainable peace and stability, now and for the future,” said Virginia Gamba.\\n\\nIn the more than a decade-long conflict, the United Nations continued to verify high levels of grave violations against children. In 2023 alone, as per the last annual report of the Secretary-general on children and armed conflict, 1,574 grave violations against children were verified across Syria. The recruitment and use (1,073 children) and the killing and maiming (475 children) were the violations verified at the highest levels.\\n\\nThe Special Representative calls on all parties to the conflict to immediately release all children from their ranks. She further urges all parties, notably Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, to engage with the United Nations on the development and implementation of action plans to prevent the future recruitment and use of children as well as other grave violations against them.\\n\\nIn this regard, the Special Representative calls on the opposition Syrian National Army, including Ahrar al-Sham and Army of Islam, and its aligned legions and factions, and the Syrian Democratic Forces to implement fully and swiftly their respective action plans, and to coordinate urgently with the United Nations on the release of children.\\n\\nThe Special Representative reminds that children should be treated primarily as victims and deprivation of liberty should only be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest period of time.

       " ReliefArticle(title='United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Mr. Geir O. Pedersen - Geneva, 10 December 2024', body=\"Let me start by saying that what has happened in the last few days, no one, absolutely no one saw this coming. I believe even the armed groups that are now in control of Damascus have been surprised by what has happened. But of course, what we have seen is a watershed moment in Syria's history with President Assad and his government ousted from power, following what can only be called an extraordinary military offensive that saw Damascus fall within two weeks.\\n\\nAnd, of course, what we basically saw was that the military of the Assad regime collapsed. But and this is important, the situation is still moving fast. Syria is now at a crossroad with great opportunities, but also with grave risks. And we need really to look at both.\\n\\nWe know that, of course, HTS is now the dominant group in control of Damascus. But it's important also to remember that they are not the only armed group in Damascus. After the fall of Aleppo, we saw a very broad range of armed opposition groups that mobilized, including, what we would call the Turkish backed Syrian National Army in the north, and the so-called former Southern Front that obviously came from the south, and also other groups that basically erupted, what I would call spontaneously as armed new formations.\\n\\nAnd let me now emphasize this, it's really an essential point, for now much of what some-called rebel-controlled Syria is under the control of what I would call a patchwork of groups, who are coordinating well, for now, but they are not fully or formally united. It's important that we don't see conflict between these groups. Let me also say that by and large, we have seen reassuring statements from the HTS and the different armed groups, but there are still some issues of law and order.\\n\\nBut we are hopeful that it will be possible to keep law and order. But also let me mention this, the conflict in the northeast is not over. There have been clashes between the Syrian National Army, the opposition group, and the SDF. We are calling obviously for calm also in this area.\\n\\nAnd then a very troubling development, we are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop. This is extremely important.\\n\\nLet me then just give what I would call three key messages, we need to continue to stress the protection of civilians. I have appealed to the armed actors to maintain good contact, law and order, and to protect civilians in line with international humanitarian law, and preserve public institutions.\\n\\nAnd as I said, I heard positive statements from the HTS and the other armed groups that they intend to continue to reassure civilians that they want to be inclusive, especially with minorities.\\n\\nMy second point linked to what I said a little bit earlier, we need to continue to work for de-escalation. We need to see a stop to the Israeli attacks, and we need to make sure that the conflict in the northeast stops. And we need to make sure that there are no conflicts developing between the different armed groups.\\n\\nBut then, third, and this is perhaps today my most important message. We need to focus on the need for credible and transitional arrangements in Damascus. This means that there needs to be what I call orderly arrangements. But it also means, and this, of course, I don't need to repeat it, but it's extremely important, it needs to be inclusive arrangements. That is, ensuring the representation of the broadest possible spectrum of Syrians, of the Syrian society and the Syrian parties. And let me say that if this is not happening, then we risk new conflict in Syria. I believe that this is understood by all groups. But what we now we need to see as this is implemented on the ground in Syria.\\n\\nAnd it is my hope that if we do this, if we unite the Syrian parties, we bring together the different Syrian communities, then this could be the real beginning of something new for Syria. And importantly, I think then we would also see a united international community supporting the Syrian transition. Then we could start to look at lifting sanctions, increased humanitarian support, starting economic recovery. We could see the return of Syrian refugees or internally displaced returning to their homes, and we could start to see, as the High Commissioner for Human Rights mentioned yesterday, that justice is finally reached. All of this needs the cooperation of the international parties and the Syrian parties. And I can promise you that the United Nations will do whatever we can to help in this situation.\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\n**Question: Do you have any contact with HTS so far or the armed groups right now in Damascus. And how much do you hope to achieve with those groups, that you didn't achieve with the Assad regime? And the second quick one would be about the moves by a certain number of European countries, suspending or denying the, the refugee, seeking asylum process in Europe. Do you welcome those moves or do you think it is, too early to tell?**\\n\\n**Question: I have a question also about HTS, this is the first time we have an ex-terrorist organization, I mean, it was Al-Qaeda in Syria that is taking the power in one country. What is your recommendation to all the countries that are considering HTS as terrorists? Do they have to speak with them? They are to clean them from the terrorist list. What is your concern for that?**\\n\\n**Question: What is your plan for the next, and any kind of the discussions will be had in the new future.**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Let me start with the question of HTS that is obviously a key question, but let me also emphasize they are not only, as I said, they are not only the armed group that are now in Damascus. So, as you all know, in Security Council resolution 2254, al-Nusra was listed as a terrorist organization. This is obviously a complicating factor for all of us.\\n\\nBut we also have to be honest, we have to look at the facts and to see what has happened during the last nine years. It is now nine years since that the resolution was adopted, and the realities so far is that the HTS, and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people.\\n\\nThey have been sending messages of, unity, of inclusiveness. And frankly speaking, also, we have seen in Aleppo and in Hama, we have also seen, you know, reassuring things on the ground. But as I stated at the very beginning, there also have been challenges.\\n\\nOn Sunday in particular in Damascus, there were lootings, there were robberies, there were, you know, the invasion of public buildings or private homes. But this seems to have stopped. And that is a good thing. But what we need now to see is, of course, that the good statements and what we are seeing on the ground at the beginning, that this is now followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us. And the most important test, the most important test will be how the transitional arrangements in Damascus is organized and implemented.\\n\\nThis arrangement, as I am emphasized many times, needs to be inclusive if they are really inclusive of all the different groups and all the communities in Syria, as I said then there is the possibility for a new beginning. And then I do believe that the international community will look at the listing of HTS again, because then there is a real change that that happen.\\n\\nAnd you will also then, heard that there are discussions, and I think, Jolani himself mentioned this in an interview with the CNN that they are discussing the possibility of dismantling HTS. So again, let me emphasize, we are still in what I would call a very fluid period, things have not settled. There is a real opportunity for change, but this opportunity needs to be grasped by the Syrians themselves and supported by the UN and the international community.\\n\\nWhat I’m now telling you I think is an advice from the key, all key international actors, as Jenifer mentioned, I was in Doha, I discussed this with the of course, with the Turkish foreign minister, with the Russian, with the Iranian, but also with the Arab foreign ministers. And we all united behind this message that we need to see what they are saying, be implemented on the ground.\\n\\nAnd this is a huge challenge. And here also let me just link to what I said earlier about the Israeli attacks. Extremely important that we now don't see any action from any international actor that destroys the possibility for this transformation in Syria to take place.\\n\\nThen I think there was a question about the refugees. Let me here give a very strong appeal that the situation in Syria is still fluid. We need to be aware of that. Things have not consolidated. But at the same time, I know from speaking to Syrians all over that they are full of hope and optimism, and many do want to go back.\\n\\nLet me just mention one example to you. When I was leaving Doha, there was a Syrian family that came towards me. They were living in Sweden, and I said, Mr. Pedersen, you know, we are so hopeful. We know there are many challenges. We left Hama 10 years ago. We really want to go back. We hope it will be possible. And I think that is really something that many, many Syrians are hoping for to this day. But let's make sure that the international community, that we are helping them in this process because there are livelihoods challenges still in Syria, as you all know, the humanitarian situation is disastrous. The economy has collapsed. So, there is a lot of responsibilities that we really need to do. And we need to do that together. Thank you.\\n\\n**One question about the process starting now, the political progress, you say it has to be inclusive, how far do you think members of the old regime should be, integrated in this process?**\\n\\n**You mentioned Israel since your stakeout in Doha on Sunday have you have been, have you had any engagement with the Israeli authorities on the appeal that you're launching to cease the bombings and with any Syrian, group, have you have any direct engagement?**\\n\\n**My request will be about Israel also, Israel has invaded the buffer zone, in the Golan Heights that it occupied after the collapse of Assad regime, in Syria. And there are also reports that says, Israel army has crossed this zone and entered Syrian territory.**\\n\\n**My questions are, do you think that this step is against international law? And also, do you call on Israel to leave at the Syrians land that it occupied?**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Let me just start with the question about, the old regime. Of course, this is an extremely crucial question. And I think here you, I have noticed that what I'm what's coming up from Damascus is that there is a need for justice, but that there is also a need for working together with the with people who served within the government structure in Damascus.\\n\\nThere is an appeal that state institutions should be kept and I, you know, and I think it was rather telling I just want to mention this - that when I briefed the Security Council yesterday, I received a message from the Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations in New York. And he was then addressing me on behalf of the authorities in Damascus. So that is still functioning.\\n\\nAnd my hope is that we will be able to see that this kind of cooperation is continuing. In other words, a focus on the need to keep state institutions and making sure, as I said, that all communities are included. And I think if these principles are followed, the Syrians would be able to sort out the distinctions between these different important questions.\\n\\nThen, as I said on Israel, I am not in contact, with the Israelis, but of course, the United Nations in New York, they are. And, you know, the peacekeepers on the Golan Heights are, of course, in daily contact with the Israelis. And of course, the message from New York is this is the same that what we are seeing is a violation of the disengagement agreement in 1974.\\n\\nSo, we will obviously, together with other colleagues in New York, follow this extremely closely in the hours and days ahead. Listen, I really appreciate this opportunity to see you again. And let's hope for a better future for Syria.\\n\\nJenifer Fenton, Spokesperson of the Special Envoy: Just in closing, the Deputy Special Envoy for Syria Ms. Najat Rochdi is currently convening the Humanitarian Task Force so will provide you with any notes from that meeting when it concludes. And we just also want to note that we have observed an increase in media freedom in many areas of Syria in recent days, including many of your colleagues. We acknowledge this development, and we urge all parties to respect media freedom and workers and journalists emphasizing that they are civilians who must be protected.\\n\\nGeneva, 10 December 2024\", original_date='2024-12-10T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Tras el reciente cambio de poder en Siria y la rápida evolución del contexto nacional y regional, Médicos del Mundo está adaptando sus actividades para hacer frente a las cambiantes necesidades de los 16,7 millones de personas sirias que dependen de la ayuda humanitaria.\\n\\nDurante los últimos 14 años, la población civil siria se ha llevado la peor parte del conflicto, con más de 500000 víctimas y 23 millones de personas desplazadas dentro o fuera de Siria, mientras las necesidades humanitarias han alcanzado niveles sin precedentes en todo el país. Durante la guerra se han atacado infraestructuras críticas, como hospitales, centrales eléctricas y las principales rutas de acceso, lo que ha obstaculizado gravemente las actividades humanitarias.\\n\\nCon una situación política y de seguridad que evoluciona rápidamente, la grave crisis humanitaria persiste. Médicos del Mundo está adaptando sus actividades, especialmente en respuesta al desplazamiento masivo de poblaciones dentro de Siria y cerca de sus fronteras. Desde el 27 de noviembre de 2024, entre 800.000 y un millón de personas han sido desplazadas en toda Siria, de las cuales 345 375 sólo en la gobernación de Idlib y más de 100.000 en el noreste del país.

Nos centraremos inicialmente en proporcionar atención médica esencial en Alepo, seguida de Hama, Homs y Damasco. Nos coordinaremos estrechamente con las autoridades sanitarias locales y los socios internacionales para garantizar la distribución eficiente de suministros médicos, incluidos medicamentos y material fungible.\\n\\n«Instamos a la comunidad internacional a mantener sus compromisos con Siria, garantizando que la financiación humanitaria cubra las crecientes necesidades y que los países de acogida reciban apoyo para proporcionar refugio a las poblaciones desplazadas.», ha declarado Ruth Diez, vocal internacional de Médicos del Mundo.\\n\\nMédicos del Mundo trabaja en el noreste de Siria, donde los últimos acontecimientos han exacerbado los problemas de seguridad tanto para la población como para el personal. Los servicios sanitarios están desbordados, y la mayoría de los centros dependen de las ONG. La llegada de más de 20 000 refugiados del Líbano y 100 000 desplazados del noroeste de Siria ha puesto aún más a prueba el frágil sistema sanitario. Los problemas de seguridad y el grave déficit de financiación limitan la expansión de la ayuda, por lo que se necesitan urgentemente recursos adicionales para ampliar la respuesta.\\n\\nMédicos del Mundo en el Noreste **Sirio ya ha desplegado dos clínicas de salud móviles en la provincia de Raqqa para proporcionar servicios de atención médica de emergencia, apoyo de salud mental y asistencia nutricional** a las personas desplazadas internas que residen en 186 escuelas que se utilizan como refugios colectivos en todas las áreas del NES.

Dado que la situación en Siria está estrechamente relacionada con cuestiones regionales, pedimos a todas las potencias de la región que cesen las hostilidades y protejan a las comunidades agotadas por años de intenso conflicto. Las infraestructuras civiles, incluidas las instalaciones médicas, deben ser protegidas y nunca deben ser objetivo de ataques. Éstas son vitales para la protección de los civiles y el suministro de ayuda humanitaria.\\n\\nDado que las condiciones humanitarias siguen siendo insuficientes para garantizar el retorno seguro de los sirios que viven en el extranjero, pedimos a los Estados que defiendan el principio de no devolución, mantengan los procedimientos de asilo para los nacionales sirios y se abstengan de deportarlos a Siria, respetando el derecho de las personas a decidir su futuro.\\n\\n**Pedimos a los donantes que den prioridad al apoyo a:**\\n\\n- Servicios sanitarios primarios y vitales en toda Siria.\\n- Acciones que refuercen las cadenas de suministro médico para superar la escasez de medicamentos esenciales y kits quirúrgicos, que ponen en peligro la atención a miles de personas.\\n- Salud mental y apoyo psicosocial para niños y adultos, ya que los servicios actuales sólo llegan a una parte de los necesitados.\\n\\n*Nota para los editores*\\n\\nMédicos del Mundo inició sus actividades en Siria en 2008, prestando servicios de atención primaria de salud en la gobernación de Alepo en colaboración con la Media Luna Roja Árabe Siria (SARC) antes de que comenzara el conflicto.

While thousands have already returned, hundreds of thousands of others are fleeing for their lives inside the country. Both need protection and support.\\n\\nThose fleeing violence and persecution have a right to seek safety and the right to seek asylum. It is therefore critical that Syrians who are compelled to flee the country are given access to territory - anyone seeking international protection must be able to access asylum procedures and have their application examined fully and **individually** on its merits, in accordance with appropriate, procedural safeguards.\\n\\nUNHCR takes note of the decision by a number of States who have suspended asylum decision-making on Syrian claims for international protection, until such time as the situation in the country has stabilized and reliable information about the security and human rights situation is available to assess the international protection needs of individual applicants.\\n\\nIn light of the uncertain and highly fluid situation the suspension of processing of asylum applications from Syrians is acceptable **as long as people can apply for asylum and are able to lodge asylum applications.**\\n\\nOnce conditions in Syria are clearer, UNHCR will also provide guidance to States on the international protection needs of relevant profiles of Syrians at risk.\\n\\nSyrian asylum-seekers who are waiting for a resumption of decision-making on their claims **should continue to be granted the same rights as all other asylum-seekers, including in terms of reception conditions. No asylum-seeker should be forcibly returned, as this would violate the non-refoulement obligation on States.**\\n\\nUNHCR continues to call on all states to ensure access to territory, asylum and protection for individuals who seek safety. This also includes respect for the principle of non-refoulement.\\n\\n## **Returns of Syrian refugees**\\n\\nAfter 14 years of conflict, recent developments bring hope that the suffering of the Syrian people may finally end, and that the world’s largest forced displacement crisis can move towards just solutions.\\n\\nAs the [UN High Commissioner for Refugees emphasized](https://www.unhcr.org/news/speeches-and-statements/statement-syria-un-high-commissioner-refugees-filippo-grandi), UNHCR’s advice is to remain focused on the issue of returns, with patience and vigilance necessary, with the hope that developments on the ground will evolve in a positive manner, allowing voluntary, safe and sustainable returns to finally occur. Refugees must be able to make informed decisions.\\n\\nMillions of Syrian refugees who remain outside, are trying to assess what the rapidly changing situation means. They are considering how safe Syria will be and how far their rights will be respected before they can make an informed voluntary decision to return home. **They must be given the space to do so without any pressure.**\\n\\nUNHCR reiterates that all refugees have the fundamental right to return to their country of origin at a time of their choosing, and **all returns must be voluntary, dignified and safe**. UNHCR stands ready to support refugee returnees as conditions allow, while underlining that during such times of uncertainty Syrians should be afforded the flexibility to assess the conditions upon return, such as through Go and See visits.\\n\\nAs the situation evolves, we will monitor developments, engage with refugee communities, and support States in any organized **voluntary** returns.\\n\\n## **Situation at Lebanon – Syria border**\\n\\nUNHCR is aware of reports of Syrians returning from Lebanon to Syria, with some movements reported through the Masnaa border crossing in the Bekaa. We understand that official border crossings in northern Lebanon are currently closed, while returns are being reported via unofficial crossings in areas such as Wadi Khaled.

Essential infrastructure, including schools and healthcare facilities, must be preserved, and pathways for civilians to flee violence safely or return home, when possible, must remain open.\\n\\nMs. Rochdi continues to engage with Syrians across all sectors, underscoring the international community’s responsibility to prevent further destabilization and to continue responding to the millions of people in need.\\n\\nMs. Rochdi urged all parties to allow unimpeded humanitarian access.

Ms. Rochdi called for urgent efforts to prevent further disruptions to critical services. She reiterated that humanitarian assistance should be delivered throughout Syria through all modalities, and based on population needs assessment.\\n\\nDespite the ever-growing needs, however, the humanitarian response continues to face a severe funding shortfall, with less than one-third of the $4.1 billion required for 2024 secured.

On the one hand, we are overjoyed that the dictatorship has ended; on the other hand, the people who have been displaced are suffering greatly.

Some families have already experienced the joy and relief of being reunited with relatives who have been held in incommunicado detention. In the coming days, we hope that more prisoners will be released and reunited with families and that over the longer term their rights to justice and truth will be secured.\\n\\nOn Friday, as news came from Syria hour by hour, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) held a conference in The Hague that brought together representatives of CSOs and International Organizations working on the issue of missing Syrians. One of the participants, Batoul Karbijha, the co-founder of the Families of Missing Asylum Seekers association, spoke eloquently about the need for victims of disappearance and the families of victims to tell their own story. She stressed that the narrative of what has happened to tens of thousands of Syrian families should not be dictated by others.\\n\\nIn many cases, this is a narrative of resilience and courage in the face of unimaginable odds.\\n\\nKarbijha established the association of missing asylums seekers after the disappearance of her sister Maysoon, who went missing – at the age of just 20 – in August 2014 while attempting to cross the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy. She was among 170 Syrians who disappeared in the same incident and whose fate remains unknown.\\n\\nKarbijha pointed out that organizations have been collecting data on missing Syrians for years but that these efforts will not bear fruit without a clear and agreed strategy among different Syrian and international agencies. “When we talk about migration, we know where mass graves are; we have data from the families but we are not connecting the data.”\\n\\nIt is imperative in the light of what has now taken place in Syria, that all stakeholders cooperate. This cooperation will make it possible to set in place an effective missing persons process capable of addressing the huge number of cases related to Syria. Such a process will make use of genetic science and database technology hopefully within a new Syrian legislative and institutional framework. It will have the support of authorities inside and outside Syria and it will sustain momentum through the direct engagement of families of the missing.\\n\\nFor justice to prevail in Syria, steps must be taken now – in the midst of present events – to protect evidence that will shed light on the circumstances in which people were detained, the charges or the absence of charges that were brought against detainees, the conditions of detention and – in cases where detainees have not survived – the circumstances of death. Places where executions and other human rights violations have occurred are crime scenes. They must be sealed and in due course examined, to protect the truth and bring those responsible for crimes to justice.\\n\\nToday – International Human Rights Day – there is a window of opportunity to take a giant step forward in accounting for Syria’s missing, including those who have disappeared in the mass displacement, at home and abroad, caused by the conflict.\\n\\nWorking with Syrian families of the missing and Syrian civil society organizations, ICMP has collected data from more than 76,200 relatives from Syria who have reported more than 28,200 missing persons. ICMP has also received reports concerning the location of 66 sites of mass graves in addition to two detention sites, through ICMP’s Online Inquiry Center (OIC) Site Locator and encourages those with information to use these resources to help find the missing.\\n\\nICMP looks forward to enhancing its cooperation with the UN Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria as it becomes fully operational. And, in the light of what has happened in recent days, ICMP looks forward to working with all stakeholders in Syria to ensure that the present opportunity to bring truth and justice to victims of enforced disappearance and their families is not missed.\\n\\nOn International Human Rights Day it is important to underline the fact that effective action can be taken quickly. Batoul Karbijha has spent years working with various organizations, investigating her sister’s disappearance. She and tens of thousands of Syrians have sought the truth – it is incumbent on all of us to work constructively and cooperatively to help them uncover that truth and to help them secure justice.\\n\\n*ICMP is a treaty-based intergovernmental organization that seeks to ensure the cooperation of governments and others in locating missing persons from conflict, human rights abuses, disasters, organized crime, migration, and other causes, and to assist them in doing so.*\\n\\n*ICMP’s Syria Program is supported by the United Kingdom and Germany*', original_date='2024-12-10T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

For millions of Syrians the overthrow of the Assad government by opposition forces this week presents a historic opportunity to transition away from decades of repression, to potentially reunite with loved ones held captive in government-run detention centers and prisons, and to openly confront the truth of the crimes perpetrated in Syria.\\n\\nThe developments in Syria present a pivotal moment to reflect upon the atrocity crimes perpetrated under Assad’s leadership and reinvigorate calls for accountability and redress. Since March 2011 the crisis in Syria has claimed more than 580,000 lives and displaced nearly 13 million people. During the conflict the Syrian government besieged, deliberately starved and bombed civilians living in opposition-controlled areas. Entire areas of Syria’s major cities and towns were razed or reduced to rubble while government airstrikes, bolstered by Russian military support, deliberately targeted protected objects. Syrian government forces also utilized chemical weapons and indiscriminate weaponry, including illegal cluster munitions and barrel bombs, to terrorize civilians. Until its collapse this week, the government continued to systematically perpetrate arbitrary arrests, torture, enforced disappearances and deaths in detention, with more than 130,0000 people reported arbitrarily detained, abducted or missing during the conflict. Armed groups, including Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the so-called Islamic State, the Syrian National Army, and others, have also been implicated in atrocities, including torture, ill-treatment, systematic looting and arbitrary detention.\\n\\nThe people of Syria – particularly those who have been victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity under Assad’s rule – deserve justice, non-recurrence, peace and stability. The change that this transition brings should not only shift Syria away from the violent conflict that has engulfed the country since 2011, but also from the decades of repression and atrocities that characterized the leadership of the Assad family. This moment should mark the beginning of a historic political transition and lead to an inclusive dialogue regarding the path forward for the people of Syria from decades of trauma. The voices of all Syrians should be centered in any discussions regarding a political transition process.\\n\\nLoved ones who have been left to wonder about the fate of their families, friends, colleagues and more may now have the opportunity to gain closure. In the short time since the fall of the capital city of Damascus and the release of thousands of prisoners from detention we have already witnessed countless scenes of families reunited with those once considered missing. In the coming days we encourage continued support for Syrian family associations. We also encourage UN member states to take this moment as an opportunity to enhance and expedite the functioning of the newly created Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria to clarify the fate of the disappeared.\\n\\nThe Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect also encourages HTS and others freeing political prisoners from Syrian detention centers to work closely with the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria and the Commission of Inquiry on Syria to ensure the documentation and preservation of evidence of the Assad government’s crimes so that one day we may achieve full accountability for the atrocities in Syria.\\n\\nThe Global Centre stands by our Syrian colleagues, including the White Helmets, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, members of the Truth and Justice Charter and countless others who have worked relentlessly toward this moment and toward a Syria free from state repression. We honor the victims and survivors of the atrocities of the past 14 years, and encourage the groups currently controlling parts of Syria to take immediate steps to ensure an end to all crimes and the prevention of their recurrence.', original_date='2024-12-09T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Overcrowded schools and mosques have been repurposed to serve as temporary shelters but lack sufficient infrastructure and resources to accommodate the displaced population. The assessment identified healthcare, protection, and food security as the most urgent needs, alongside critical gaps in shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. Vulnerable groups, including women, children, elderly individuals, and persons with disabilities, face heightened risks due to inadequate protection measures and limited access to tailored services. Additionally, safety concerns such as gender-based violence (GBV) and child labor were highlighted, further emphasizing the need for robust interventions. Immediate recommendations include the establishment of mobile clinics, the provision of winterization materials such as blankets and heating equipment, and the improvement of WASH facilities in shelters. Long-term solutions emphasize the need for sustainable livelihood opportunities, skill-building programs, and the rehabilitation of education services for displaced children.

This escalation is also reported in Idleb and is moving towards Hama Governorate at the time of this DREF request. Since the onset, reports of civilian casualties, mass displacements, and extensive damage to civilian property and infrastructure have surfaced. Many humanitarian organizations have suspended their activities, and large numbers of people are reportedly trapped in frontline areas, trying to reach safer zones.\\n\\nOn November 29 and 30, curfews were enforced in Aleppo City. Markets and streets were reported to be empty, despite the availability of essential goods. In the last four days, the hostilities have intensified, with reports of offensives in multiple locations. The hostilities with significant humanitarian implications are reported in Aleppo, Hama, Idleb, and to a lesser degree in Dar’a, Rural Damascus, Homs, and As-Sweida. The impact on civilians includes displacements, deaths, and injuries, as well as restricted access to critical humanitarian assistance and essential services, including healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene, protection, and food necessary for survival.\\n\\nThe situation remains fluid, and the hostilities are continuing in multiple areas. There is a high likelihood that more areas will be affected by these offensives as the situation remains unpredictable.\\n\\n**Scope and Scale**\\n\\nIt is estimated that the ongoing situation in the northern governorates of Syria, specifically Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, has led to the displacement of approximately 500,000 individuals inside and outside these governorates in search of safety and protection.\\n\\nAll governorates, especially those directly affected, are currently facing a severe shortage of humanitarian assistance and necessities due to the protracted crisis, which is considered one of the longest and most complex in the world. Already weakened communities in these areas have not fully recovered from the devastation of the earthquake that struck the region in 2023, further worsening their already dire situation. Additionally, neighboring areas previously inundated by waves of displacement are now under additional strain on their resources and services. The onset of winter has exacerbated vulnerabilities, leaving families without adequate shelter, heating, or essential non-food items.\\n\\nMoreover, the recent displacement has disproportionately affected women, children, and the elderly, increasing their needs compared to other demographics and exposing them to additional risks. Despite efforts to alleviate the crisis, maintaining resilience in the most vulnerable families becomes increasingly challenging within the fragile context of limited and often absent resources.\\n\\nIn areas like Aleppo and Idlib, the gap between life-saving basic needs and resources accessible to the affected populations widens due to conflict and the lack of safe access to service providers and supplies, despite facilitation by many stakeholders and interest parties.\\n\\nThis increase in violence has exacerbated the vulnerabilities of communities already struggling with the prolonged crisis, earthquake repercussions, economic difficulties, the recent influx of displacement from Lebanon, and direct environmental pressures in densely populated areas.\\n\\nThe armed operations are not over as of the drafting of this request and further escalation could be expected in the coming days. The area of conflict has widened through Aleppo and rural Aleppo, Eastern and southern Idleb, and northern Hama. The population living in the currently affected areas is estimated at 3,170,000 people. Isolated incidents have also been recorded in other governorates which would increase the risk of further displacement within these governorates or in-between different governorates.

Expanding protection services and health support, particularly for vulnerable groups, is also critical.\\n- Conflict and insecurity have disrupted critical transportation routes, limiting the movement of people and goods, and also affecting the delivery of aid. Some looting of civilian properties and factories, as well as warehouses holding humanitarian supplies has been reported.\\n- The unofficial exchange rate hit a record high, reaching SYP25000/$1 in Damascus and SYP41,000/$1 in Aleppo. Commodity prices have increased sharply with reports of shortages of goods in Damascus.\\n\\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\\n\\nSince the escalation of hostilities on November 28, approximately one million people have been displaced internally. This includes 155,000 people experiencing secondary displacement. The majority of those displaced are women and children, with women and girls comprising nearly 50 percent of those forced to flee their homes. The most affected governorates are Aleppo, with 542,600 displaced persons, followed by Hama (347,100) and Homs (26,000).\\n\\nSince the fall of the Government in Damascus on 8 December, clashes have been reported in Menbij (Aleppo Governorate) and Deir-ez-Zor, with less fighting reported in other areas.\\n\\nConflict has damaged civilian infrastructure and humanitarian assets, and disrupted services, in northeast Syria. Around 185 schools in Raqqa, Al-Hasakeh, and Tabqa have been repurposed as shelters for IDPs, disrupting education for nearly 185,000 students. Healthcare services are under strain, with hospitals like Ar-Raqqa National and Maternity Hospitals preparing for increased patient loads due to the influx of displaced individuals. WASH services are also impacted, with efforts underway to provide WASH facilities in collective centers. Additionally, the displacement has overwhelmed transit sites, highlighting the urgent need for winterization supplies, communal cooking facilities, and core relief items to support vulnerable populations.\\n\\nHostilities along the road between Quamishli and Damascus have been hindering population movement and the transportation of humanitarian shipments. This has made it difficult to deliver essential aid to affected areas. Additionally, the capacity of reception centers in cities like Ar-Raqqa and Tabqa is limited, and these shelters, often converted sports centers and schools, are overcrowded with displaced persons. These facilities urgently require additional resources, including WASH facilities, tents, food, and non-food items to meet the growing demand.', original_date='2024-12-08T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='Never again: UN Syria Commission urges incoming authorities to break the cycle of violence and usher in new rights-respecting era [EN/AR]', body=\"**GENEVA (8 December 2024)** – Today marks a historic new beginning for the Syrian people who have suffered unspeakable violence and atrocities over the past 14 years. It is time to finally put Syrians’ own aspirations first and place the country on a path toward a stable, prosperous and just future that guarantees the human rights and dignity its people have so long been denied, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said today after a coalition of forces seized Damascus and freed political prisoners from Sednaya and other detention facilities.\\n\\n“The Syrian people should be allowed to view this historical moment as the end of decades of state-organized repression,” said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission.\\n\\n“Prisoners being released after decades in arbitrary detention from the infamous Sednaya Prison outside Damascus is a scene that millions of Syrians could not have imagined a few days ago,” Pinheiro said. “It is incumbent on those now in charge to ensure that such atrocities are never again repeated within the walls of Sednaya or any other detention centre in Syria.”\\n\\nAcross the territory rapidly taken over by armed groups led by Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the past few days have seen the release of thousands of prisoners who have endured years, or even decades, of incommunicado detention. This should bring immense relief to the freed individuals and their families and offers hope to those still awaiting news of the tens of thousands of disappeared loved ones.\\n\\nFor decades, Sednaya and other infamous detention facilities have been synonymous with fear, loss, suffering and cruelty. The cells where detainees were ill-treated are now open, as are the interrogation chambers where they were tortured using cruel methods that the Commission has [documented](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/coisyria/A-HRC-53-CRP5-Syria-Torture.pdf) for [years](https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/g21/059/73/pdf/g2105973.pdf).\\n\\n“Throughout the war, families have put themselves in grave danger and paid exorbitant sums in bribes to corrupt State officials for news about their detained loved ones. Now, in videos just released from inside detention facilities, we see rooms with rows of shelves filled with these files. HTS and the other armed groups now taking control of the detention centres must take great care not to disturb evidence of violations and crimes,” said Commissioner Lynn Welchman.\\n\\n“The long and arduous search for Syria’s disappeared now has a chance to progress exponentially. We call on Member States to continue to support the Syrian family associations and the new UN institution dedicated to this work,” said Commissioner Hanny Megally.\\n\\n“In the meantime, we hope the authorities will ensure that all persons freed from arbitrary and unlawful detention are quickly supported to ensure family reunification and appropriate medical and psychological support,” Megally added.\\n\\nThe Commission calls on all parties in Syria to facilitate access for independent humanitarian and human rights actors, including the Commission, to the country, including detention facilities. It stresses the importance of ensuring that all evidence is protected.\\n\\nBoth opposition and Government leadership have made initial statements indicating their commitment to maintaining good conduct and protecting civilians, which is encouraging. Their deeds must now match their words.\\n\\nThe groups now controlling large areas have a chance to break the destructive cycle of pillage and plunder that the Commission has often documented in the wake of shifts in territorial control and mass displacement. It encourages their leadership to take immediate steps to prevent looting and ensure the protection of homes and possessions left behind by the hundreds of thousands who have been displaced this past week.\\n\\nENDS\\n\\n***Note:** In the coming days, the Commission will release a new report highlighting the vast scale of systematic looting and destruction of homes that has ravaged the country, often in the wake of shifts in territorial control and ensuing mass displacement.*\\n\\n***Background**: The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established on 22 August 2011 by the Human Rights Council through resolution* [*S-17/1*](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/ResS17_1.pdf)*.The mandate of the Commission is to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Human Rights Council also tasked the Commission with establishing the facts and circumstances that may amount to such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to identify those responsible with a view of ensuring that perpetrators of violations, including those that may constitute crimes against humanity, are held accountable. The Human Rights Council has repeatedly extended the Commission's mandate since then, most recently until 31 March 2025.*\\n\\n***More information** on the work of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria can be found* [*here*](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/iici-syria/independent-international-commission)*.*\\n\\n***For media requests, please contact:** Johan Eriksson, UN Syria Commission of Inquiry Media Adviser, at +41 76 691 0411 / johan.eriksson@un.org; or Todd Pitman, Media Adviser, Investigative Missions, at +41766911761 / todd.pitman@un.org; Pascal Sim, Human Rights Council Media Officer at +41229179763 / simp@un.org.*\", original_date='2024-12-08T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='Transcript of Press Stakeout of United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Mr. Geir O. Pedersen (8 December 2024)', body=\"Obviously today it’s really a watershed moment in the history of Syria. It’s a nation that has endured 14 years nearly of relentless suffering and unspeakable loss. And let me once again extend my deepest solidarity to all who have borne the weight of death, destruction, detention, and untold human rights violations. This dark chapter has left deep scars, but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new time - one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians.\\n\\nTo those displaced, this moment renews the vision of returning to homes once lost. To families separated by war, the beginning of reunions bring hope. To those unjustly detained, and the families of the detained and the missing, the opening of the prisons reminds us of justice’s eventual reach.\\n\\nBut the challenges ahead remain immense and we hear those who are anxious and apprehensive. Yet this is the moment to embrace the possibility for renewal in Syria. The resilience of the Syrian people offers a path forward to a united and peaceful Syria.\\n\\nBut to this end, let me emphasize the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place urgently, and that the Syrian institutions continue to function, and that the Syrian people are enabled to begin to chart the path to meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and restore a unified Syria, with its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in a way that can receive the support and engagement of the entire international community.\\n\\nI have heard in the last few days and in the last few hours a message from many Syrians, including armed groups and civil society, both women and men, and have noted public statements underlining a will to protect their fellow Syrians and state institutions going forward against retribution and harm.\\n\\nAnd this is important, let me also echo these statements and issue a clear and unambiguous appeal at this hour that all armed actors on the ground maintain good conduct, law and order, protect civilians and preserve public institutions.\\n\\nLet me urge all Syrians to prioritize dialogue, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law, and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society. Let me stress that there must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all. And that I stand ready to support the Syrian people in their journey towards a stable and inclusive future decided and shaped by the Syrian people themselves.\\n\\nToday let’s honor the memory of those who have suffered for decades by committing to help Syrians build a Syria where justice, freedom, and prosperity are shared realities. Let us stand in solidarity with Syrians to help them ensure that this new chapter is one of hope and opportunity for every Syrian.\\n\\nLet me now take a few questions.\\n\\n**What steps is the United Nations prepared to take to support a post-Assad Syria, and achieving democratic governance ensuring accountability for war crimes and rebuilding the country while preventing further regional instability**?\\n\\nAs you heard in my statement, it's extremely important that all Syrians now come together and lay the foundations for a future Syria that can meet the aspirations that they have been fighting for for the last 14 years. We need to start today with establishing as I said transitional arrangements, that's the first priority. And then we need to build on that to secure peace, to prevent that Syria is divided, and then we will continue the discussions on all the items that you mentioned here today. But today, first things first.\\n\\n**Where is President Assad now, where is his family, what health condition are they in? And also do you think he should be tried for war crimes?**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Good question. I think we're all asking the same questions today, and frankly I have no more information than you have.\\n\\n**(Questions inaudible) for the war crimes?**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Listen, we all know that the long arms of justice will continue to work, and how is this going to develop, I have no, there is no easy answer to this. As I rightly said I have no idea where he is. So, these are questions that will have to be answered in full detail later down the road.\\n\\n**We heard from Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan there pretty clear both a call for a peaceful transition in Syria, but also a pretty clear condemnation of the SDF. It’s been very clear to us at the Forum over the past two days that there is real disagreement between the major powers** **that have sway in Syria. How do you now as you move forward with this transition ensure that countries like Iran, Türkiye, Russia, can play constructive roles in this?**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Listen, I think it's not only about Iran, and Türkiye, and Russia, it is also obviously about the Arab states, it's about Jordan, it's about Lebanon, and of course also a broader group of Arab States. And I had the pleasure yesterday evening meeting with the foreign ministers from obviously Qatar, as the host, from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Jordan - did I forget someone - and then the Russians, and the Turks, and the Iranians. In that meeting, my message to all of them was - this is the time for making sure that we have inclusive transitional arrangements that include all communities in Syria.\\n\\nThis is of course first and foremost the responsibility of the Syrians, but it will require as I said yesterday, the help of all of you around the table. I'm pleased to say that at least as of yesterday this was the common message coming out from that group, and the strong support for the work, the hard work ahead of us and the support to the role of the United Nations in this respect.\\n\\n**You called for a meeting I think in Geneva next week, who will be invited? When it comes to the opposition, the HTS is one of the key players now on the ground in Syria, while its leader is on terrorist list. How will you deal with that, and I know recently even delivering aid to Idlib was a problem because as the HTS was on the ground and they are on the terrorist list and now they are a key player in Syria, how will you deal with it?**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Let's be honest, the situation on the ground has changed dramatically. Obviously, the fact that HTS is a listed group creates challenges. It's extremely important that we now see on the ground a development that proves that we can achieve, you know, a transition to what I hope will be a democratic future for Syria.\\n\\nAnd here we are following of course extremely closely what is happening on the ground with all armed factions, and then there are certain procedures in place that will have to be followed - if they are to be delisted. That is a process that I'm not in control of, but obviously we will continue to work to try, as I said, to make sure that we have as an inclusive process as possible, but let me be honest this is work in progress. Because as I said yesterday, the realities on the ground are changing all the time, and of course as we are speaking we are seeing some developments in Damascus that I hope we can see an end to, and I hope that we will not see continued clashes, but, and this will be our appeal, as I have said in my statement, to all groups, and then we are working to see how we can move this process forward.\\n\\n**We are seeing that the armed groups in Damascus they are willing to cooperate with the Syrian government, so do you think that the Syrian government or any member of the regime should take part in the transition?**\\n\\nMr. Pedersen: Let me be honest with you, what we are seeing coming out of Damascus are what I would call contradictory messages at this time, but what I think is important to stress is that we avoid bloodshed, that there is a dialogue, that there is an inclusive process and a preparation for transitional arrangements. This is now my key message to all - avoid bloodshed, make sure that it is inclusive, that all communities in Syria are included, and that the nervousness that some are facing, are fearing, that we can address this, and move forward to peace and stability. And as I said, it could be the beginning really for a new Syria. Let's hope that there is a willingness to work together to that, and as I said we will do whatever we can to help. Thank you so much, great to see you.\\n\\n*Doha, 8 December 2024*\", original_date='2024-12-08T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='Whole of Syria Nutrition Cluster Statement: Protecting Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition during the Emergency Response in Syria', body='> **UNICEF, WHO, Whole of Syria Nutrition Cluster the Global Nutrition Cluster, the IFE Core Group, and partners call for ALL involved in the response to the Emergency in Syria to protect, promote, and support the feeding and care of infants and young children, their caregivers, especially pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women. This is critical to support maternal and child survival, growth and development, and to prevent malnutrition, illness and death.**\\n> \\n> **This statement has been issued to help secure, coordinated, multi-sectoral and young child feeding (IYCF) to support and provide care for infants and their caregivers during the emergency response.**\\n\\nThe recent escalation of hostilities in Syria has increased humanitarian needs for the areas directly affected by the escalations in hostilities, with echoed indirect effects on other people living in Syria specially in Aleppo, Idleb and Hama Governorates. [UN OCHA notes that the security situation in Syria remains volatile, unpredictable, and rapidly evolving in many parts of the country](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/escalation-hostilities-syria-flash-update-1-december-2nd-2024), particularly in the northern and northwestern regions. Escalating hostilities continue to impact civilians, civilian infrastructure, and humanitarian access and operations. In Aleppo city, reports indicate significant civilian casualties, including women and children.\\n\\nAs of 5 December, UN OCHA reports that at least 178,000 people have been displaced due to the recent escalations in northern Syria, including 128,000 newly displaced and 39,000 displaced at least twice. Figures are still being reconciled, noting that UNHCR and NGOs operating in the northeastern part of Syria estimate that between 60,000 and 80,000 people have been newly displaced there, including more than 25,000 currently hosted in collective centers.\\n\\nPublic health concerns are escalating due to the presence of unburied bodies, lack of potable water, and the pre-existing risk of waterborne diseases such as suspected cholera. According to UN OCHA flash updates (as of 3rd December), the conflict has severely disrupted health and nutrition services. Several healthcare facilities, including one of main hospitals and a maternity hospital in Idleb city have been damaged, with 35 health organizations unable to continue their operations in Aleppo as of early December 2024. This has led to the closure of key health facilities, including hospitals and primary health care centers, affecting over 1.7 million procedures and nearly one million treatment courses in Aleppo. Provision of health services such as trauma care, maternal health, and disease surveillance is severely limited by the displacement of health workers and the prevailing insecurity.\\n\\nCurrently, Syrian communities are simultaneously hit with an on-going cholera outbreak and significantly overwhelmed health facilities. With harsh winter arriving which maybe coupled with heavy rain, floods and snowing. Even before the ongoing escalation of hostilities, Syrian women and children have been subjected to physical injuries, lack of health-care services, lack of shelter, food shortages, unsanitary conditions, risk of communicable diseases, protection threats and high levels of stress and uncertainty.\\n\\nWomen and children, especially pregnant girls and women, infants and young children and postpartum women, are populations that are extremely vulnerable in Syria. During such emergencies, the importance of breastfeeding and increase of the morbidity and mortality risks associated with not breastfeeding are more pronounced.\\n\\nIn all emergencies, the youngest children are at the highest risk of illness and mortality. Infants who are not breastfed are especially vulnerable as they are not receiving the protection and benefits of breastmilk. For babies and young children in humanitarian and fragile settings, access to early childhood development (ECD) services is a matter of life and death. Supporting them and their caregivers is essential to ending preventable newborn and under-five deaths and fostering healthy brain development.\\n\\nIn Syria where the rate of exclusive breastfeeding ranges from 19%-29% and a high percentage of children are partially or fully dependent on commercial infant formula. The dietary intake of infants and young children aged 6-23 months is extremely poor with majority of children 6-23 months (68%) in Syria experiencing child food poverty. With the deteriorating access to nutritious foods, essential services and feeding practices, the diets of young children are the risk of deteriorating further.\\n\\nAt least 1 in 4 children in Syria suffers from anemia, emphasizing the detrimental effects of sub-optimal diets lacking essential nutrients. On maternal nutrition, 1 in 4 women aged 15-49 years suffers from anemia, with an even higher prevalence observed among teenage girls, where 1 in 2 girls is anemic. Additionally, 1 in 10 women is wasted, contributing to increased risks during pregnancy. Diarrheal episodes among children have surged, affecting one in four, amid an Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreak in 2023-24. Recurrent diarrhoea is associated with 50 per cent of undernourishment. Measles outbreaks in several governorates further compromises child nutrition status. Measles vaccination in Idleb and Aleppo Governorates are sub-optimal, ranging between serious and extreme (Syrian Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), 2024).\\n\\nBreastfeeding is lifesaving. It provides children with hydration, comfort, connection, high quality nutrition and protection against disease, shielding them from the worst of emergency conditions. This ability has been described as empowering and healing by some breastfeeding women. Breastfeeding also has important consequences for maternal mental health, physical health, and caregiving capacity, as well as long-term child development and educational attainment.\\n\\nBetween the ages of 6 and 23 months – the complementary feeding period – breastfeeding and access to a diverse range of nutritious foods provide children with the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals they need to develop to their full physical and cognitive potential, with benefits that endure well into adulthood. The complementary feeding period is also a critical opportunity to prevent all forms of childhood malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. In addition, lifelong food preferences, tastes and habits are often established in childhood.\\n\\n> **Globally Recommended Maternal Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices**\\n> \\n> 1\\\\. Early initiation of breastfeeding (uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth and putting baby to the breast within 1 hour of birth)  \\n> 2\\\\. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months (no food or liquid other than breastmilk, not even water unless medically indicated)  \\n> 3\\\\. Introduction of age-appropriate, safe, and nutritionally adequate complementary feeding at 6 months (180 days) to 2 years of age; that meet recommended minimum meal frequency and dietary diversity (5 or more food groups) while continuing to breastfeed; and  \\n> 4\\\\. Continued breastfeeding for 2 years or beyond  \\n> 5\\\\. Responsive feeding for children 6-23 months of age, defined as “feeding practices that encourage the child to eat autonomously and in response to physiological and developmental needs, which may encourage self-regulation in eating and support cognitive, emotional and social development”  \\n> 6\\\\. Ensure pregnant and breastfeeding women, have priority access to food and non-food items\\n\\n**Interventions to support mothers, caregivers and their children should consider:**\\n\\n1\\\\. **Support mothers to initiate and continue breastfeeding as a priority to help protect their health and well-being and that of their infants.** Although stress can temporarily interfere with the flow of breast milk in some women, it is not likely to inhibit breast milk production, provided mothers and infants remain together and are supported to initiate and continue frequent breastfeeding. This support entails practical support with attachment and positioning for breastfeeding, confidence building, facilitating skin-to-skin contact and keeping mother and infant together (e.g., provide baby carriers/slings). It is recommended to draw upon existing breastfeeding support organisations and individual lactation specialists from Syria and surrounding countries in the region.\\n\\n2\\\\. **Keep mothers and babies together, even if one becomes ill -** Mothers should continue to breastfeed even if they are pregnant or become sick. Antibodies in the milk of the mother, even if she is sick, will help protect their babies from any diseases. If a sick mother is holding or feeding a baby (whether breastfeeding or using commercial infant formula), she must follow hygiene practices, wear a mask and wash her hands before and after feeding the child.\\n\\n3\\\\. **Support and protect nutritional needs of children during Cholera Outbreaks -** Referral of suspected cholera case to cholera treatment centre (CTC) is vital because of high risk of cross infection with other children and the need of correct rehydration of the child with acute watery diarrhea (AWD). A strong referral system to be established and maintained between ORC/DTC and OTP/TFC. Rehydration solution for malnutrition (ReSoMal) Should not be given if children are suspected of having AWD or have profuse watery diarrhoea. Such children should be given standard WHO low osmolarity oral rehydration solution that is normally made, i.e. further diluted/standard rehydration solution. Therapeutic foods already contain adequate zinc, therefore children with severe acute malnutrition and profuse AWD/Cholera receiving F-75, F-100 or RUTF should not receive any additional zinc supplement. Breastfeeding is protective against cholera and should continue to be prioritised, recommended, and supported through an outbreak and separation of mothers and their infants should be avoided if at all possible.\\n\\n4\\\\. **Support and protect the nutritional needs of infants and young children who are not breastfed and minimise the risks they are exposed to.** Infants who are exclusively dependent on infant formula are highly vulnerable in the current situations and should be urgently identified, assessed, and supplied with a comprehensive package of essential support. This package should include adequate Breast Milk Substitute (powdered infant formula or ready to use infant formula) supplies, equipment and supplies for hygienic storage, preparation and cup feeding, practical training on hygienic preparation and storage, and counselling on responsive feeding for the entire length of time that the child requires. The support should also provide for ongoing, regular follow up at designated shelter and reception areas and within other service provision in Syria. Mothers who are not exclusively breastfeeding should be encouraged and supported to increase their confidence on supporting their infants and return to exclusive breastfeeding. Orphaned infants and other vulnerable infants who are not being breastfed should be supported with re-lactation and wet-nursing support as a first line intervention.\\n\\n5\\\\. In accordance with the Whole of Syria Nutrition Sector Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on Donations, Targeted Distribution and Procurement of Breastmilk Substitute (2017) and international standards and guidance, **do not call for, support, accept or distribute donations of Breastmilk Substitutes, including commercial infant formula, other milk products, commercial complementary foods, and feeding equipment (such as bottles, teats, and breast pumps). However, If the procurement of Breast milk substitute is needed,** the required commercial infant formula - Ready to use infant formula (RUIF), procured by UNICEF or other partners should be in line with the WHO International Code of Marketing and Breast Milk Substitutes, ‘the Code’, [UNICEF Guidance on the Procurement and Use of Breastmilk Substitutes in Humanitarian Settings](https://www.unicef.org/documents/procurement-and-use-breastmilk-substitutes-humanitarian-settings) and (subsequent WHA resolutions) and provided as part of a sustained package of coordinated care based on assessed need and should be Code-compliant. All partners must report the code violations to the nutrition cluster coordinators, immediately for necessary action, and support. All code violations must be recorded and responded to adequately, in the best capacity available in the response. For infants 6-23 months of age and above, breast feeding continues to be the recommended practice. For those who are not breastfed, acceptable milk sources include full-cream animal milk (cow, goat, buffalo, sheep, camel), Ultra High Temperature (UHT) milk, reconstituted evaporated (but not condensed) milk, fermented milk, or yogurt, and expressed breast milk. Any animal milk given to infants <12 months should be boiled and left to cool before giving the milk. Milk products should never be included in general distribution and should be accompanied by key messages and guidance on infant and young child feeding in emergencies.\\n\\n6\\\\. **Ensure the availability and continuity of nutritious, appropriate and fresh food for children, pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, and families.** Where there are identified shortfalls in local access and availability of foods, facilitate access to age-appropriate and hygienically prepared, complementary foods for children 6-23 months. Facilitate access of nutritious foods for older children, and for their caregivers, with particular attention to pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women. All partners must promote access to food and shelter through coordinated support from other sector agencies and partners. Women and children must be included as vulnerable groups within all national and partner supported social safety nets. Direct cash support must be considered in hard-to-reach and affected populations.\\n\\n**7. Provide support to mothers and caregivers to access early childhood development (ECD) services and enable them to provide responsive feeding and care to infants and young children** - Provide critical ECD services including creating safe spaces for babies and young children to play and learn, training caregivers and frontline workers to provide nurturing environments, and counselling caregivers to bolster their own well-being. Additionally supporting mothers and caregivers to provide responsive feeding to infants and young children to enable them encourage children to eat, provide food in response to their appetite and satiety signals and feed them with care. Counselling on responsive feeding can promote self-feeding, improve nutrient intake, and reduce the risk of undernutrition and overweight.\\n\\n8\\\\. **Ensure pregnant and breastfeeding women, and other caretakers of young children have priority access to non-food items including appropriate accommodation, clothing, water, protection, mental health and psychosocial support, gender-based violence related support, and other interventions to meet their essential needs.** Consider how women in transit can be supported to minimise distress during their journey. At all service points, provide safe and comfortable spaces for mothers to feed and care for their infants and young children.\\n\\n9\\\\. **Identify higher risk infants, children, and mothers and respond to their needs.** These include (but are not limited to) pregnant and post-partum women; newborns; low birth weight infants; malnourished children, including infants under 6 months of age; children with disabilities; children experiencing issues with feeding; 0-23 months and unaccompanied children; maternal orphans; institutionalised; mothers who are malnourished or severely ill; mothers who are experiencing mental health crisis; instances where mothers are separated from their children.

The meetings were designed to enhance cooperation among governments, Syrian civil society organizations (CSOs), and international agencies to find more than 150,000 Syrians and non-Syrians missing in Syria, as well as Syrian refugees missing along migratory routes.\\n\\nFrom 4 to 5 December, ICMP hosted the 13th meeting of the Data Governance Group (DGG) for Syria, which brought together Syrian data partners to enhance measures to adhere to best practice in data collection, management and protection. Thus far, data has been collected from more than 75,000 relatives of the missing. Participants discussed the establishment of the ICMP Committee on Data, which will consist of families of the missing and be referenced in personal data collection and processing consent forms.\\n\\nOn 6 December, ICMP held an Interagency Roundtable, bringing together international agencies and Syrian families and CSOs to discuss measures for a safe and functional data coordination system that allows comprehensive access to missing persons data while safeguarding family and witness privacy. The roundtable examined how data management systems can be structured to ensure efficient data categorization, collection, and protection, with input from families and civil society. The discussion also highlighted the need to enhance the capacity of Syrian organizations to document missing persons cases to international legal standards, ensuring that information that is gathered is admissible in legal proceedings.\\n\\n“The Syrian conflict and ongoing crisis have been referred to as the best documented conflict in modern times. Over the last decade, Syrian organizations have collected large quantities of data on those who have gone missing. In many cases this data has been obtained at great risk,” the Director -General of ICMP, Kathryne Bomberger said. “The creation of the UN Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria, which has not yet begun operations, presents an opportunity to look into this issue in more depth, which is what we hoped to achieve through these meetings.”\\n\\nData collected thus far in Syria has largely focused on reporting and analyzing human rights abuses and other atrocities that cause persons to go missing; recording names, locations and circumstances of disappearances, along with additional information that may help to identify possible perpetrators. This has been done by collecting data directly from families of the missing or from witnesses, and by triangulating open-source information and satellite/aerial imagery. These efforts have focused on missing persons inside Syria, with little effort to collect data on Syrians who have gone missing along migratory routes to Europe and beyond.\\n\\nEfforts to locate Syrians missing along migratory routes and as a result of human trafficking were also discussed, with an emphasis on integrating refugee data in the system in order to enhance coordination and information-sharing across borders.\\n\\nIn addition to the more than 150,000 people believed to be missing as a result of the conflict, Syria has a legacy of missing and disappeared persons cases linked to human rights abuses and other causes prior to the conflict, as well as the thousands who have fled the fighting and have gone missing along migratory routes.\\n\\nData coordination is a key component of laying the foundation for a sustainable missing persons strategy for Syria that is impartial, credible and transparent. It is also key to securing the rights of families of the missing to justice, truth and reparations.\\n\\nWorking with families of the missing and with governments to develop an effective system to find missing Syrians, ICMP has collected data from more than 76,200 relatives from Syria who have reported more than 28,200 missing persons. ICMP has also received reports concerning the location of 66 sites of mass graves in addition to two detention sites, through ICMP’s Online Inquiry Center (OIC) Site Locator.\\n\\nThese initiatives are supported by the United Kingdom and Germany, key partners in ICMP’s Syria/MENA Program.\\n\\n**About ICMP**  \\n ICMP is a treaty-based intergovernmental organization that seeks to ensure the cooperation of governments and others in locating missing persons from conflict, human rights abuses, disasters, organized crime, migration, and other causes, and to assist them in doing so.

For many pregnant women, these clinics were their only source of prenatal and delivery care, and their closure now places them in severe and life-threatening danger.\\n\\nThese clinics, some of the last remaining in the region after years of instability, served Syria’s most vulnerable communities, where maternal health resources are critically limited.

During the ongoing crisis, SFPA has expanded its reach through static clinics, mobile health teams, safe spaces for women and girls, and psychosocial support services, ensuring that essential care reaches even the most vulnerable populations.*\\n\\n***About IPPF***\\n\\n*IPPF is a global healthcare provider and a leading advocate of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all.

Today, we are a movement of 150 Member Associations and Collaborative Partners with a presence in over 146 countries. Our work is wide-ranging, including comprehensive sex education, provision of contraceptives, safe abortion, and maternal care and responding to humanitarian crises. We pride ourselves on being local through our members and global through our network. At the heart of our mission is the provision of – and advocacy in support of – integrated healthcare to anyone who needs it regardless of race, gender, sex, income, and crucially no matter how remote.*\\n\\n*Our services are available to all, and reach the most marginalised groups in societies, including key and priority populations, youth, and people with disabilities. Most of our MAs have special programs to engage youth (10-24) inside and outside of school settings. Because our clinics offer comprehensive services, attending our clinics is non-stigmatizing and does not label people as having a particular disease or membership to a particular group. This model of services that are integrated and open to all, embedded in indigenous, locally owned organisations, is ideal for ensuring that the most vulnerable and marginalised groups can access the HIV prevention services they need.*', original_date='2024-12-06T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

They reported horrific conditions, lack of hygiene, insufficient food and water, overcrowding, and denial of medical care. Many witnessed other detainees being tortured and killed.\\n\\nThe report includes descriptions of Syrian Government structures involved in the infliction of harms, including Government leadership and coordinating entities, intelligence branches, military hospitals and military police.\\n\\n**Impact on Families**\\n\\nThe Detention Report also sheds light on the devastating impact on the families of disappeared detainees. The anguish and distress have caused long-term consequences for whole communities.\\n\\n“Thousands of families bear the psychological toll of not knowing where their loved ones are,” Mr. Petit said. Speaking of the role of the Government, he added “This is unimaginable psychological torture, yet the Syrian Government continues to intentionally withhold and cover-up information that could address the agonising uncertainty.”\\n\\nIn accordance with witness protection considerations and consent limitations, the Detention Report has been released in redacted format.

C’est en ces termes que le Japon a résumé, ce matin, le constat d’une majorité de membres du Conseil, à la suite de l’exposé mensuel de la Haute-Représentante pour les affaires de désarmement sur les dernières avancées du dossier relatif à l’utilisation présumée d’armes chimiques en République arabe syrienne.\\n\\nVenue faire le point sur l’état de la mise en œuvre de la résolution 2118 (2013) du Conseil, relative à l’élimination du programme d’armes chimiques de la République arabe syrienne, Mme Izumi Nakamitsu a souligné que la pleine coopération de la Syrie avec le Secrétariat technique de l’OIAC est essentielle pour résoudre les questions encore en suspens. « Compte tenu des lacunes, des incohérences et des divergences identifiées et non résolues, le Secrétariat technique estime que la déclaration soumise par la Syrie ne peut toujours pas être considérée comme exacte et complète au regard de la Convention sur l’interdiction des armes chimiques », a-t-elle déclaré, avant d’inviter une nouvelle fois les autorités syriennes à coopérer et à répondre d’urgence aux demandes qui lui sont faites.\\n\\n**Des questions portant sur de grandes quantités d’agents de guerre chimique**\\n\\nMme Nakamitsu a rappelé qu’à ce jour, l’Équipe d’évaluation des déclarations de l’OIAC a identifié 26 questions en suspens, dont 19 irrésolues, parmi lesquelles celles récemment ouvertes concernant le développement et la production à grande échelle d’armes chimiques dans deux installations qui avaient été déclarées précédemment comme n’ayant jamais été en activité. Ces questions sont d’autant plus « préoccupantes » qu’elles concernent de grandes quantités d’agents de guerre chimique et de munitions dont le sort ne peut être entièrement vérifié par l’OIAC. Elles portent également sur des quantités potentiellement importantes d’agents de guerre chimique dont la production n’a pas été déclarée par la Syrie au Secrétariat technique de l’OIAC.\\n\\nEn réponse, la Syrie a assuré s’être acquittée de toutes ses obligations au titre de la Convention à laquelle elle a adhéré il y a plus de 11 ans. Elle a aussi réaffirmé son engagement à poursuivre sa coopération avec l’OIAC et son Secrétariat technique. À ce titre, la délégation syrienne a mentionné les trois derniers rapports mensuels soumis par l’autorité nationale syrienne, les éléments d’information et les explications scientifiques fournis au sujet des échantillons prélevés par l’Équipe d’évaluation des déclarations en mai dernier, ainsi que l’appui technique apporté à l’équipe d’inspection de l’OIAC qui s’est rendue dans des installations du Centre d’études et de recherches scientifiques. Sur cette base, elle a demandé qu’il soit mis fin à toute « manipulation politique » de ce dossier.\\n\\nSur cette même ligne, la Fédération de Russie a regretté que le Secrétariat technique de l’OIAC « continue docilement d’exécuter l’ordre occidental de dénigrer la Syrie » en promouvant des « thèses éculées » sur le prétendu non-respect par Damas de ses obligations au titre de la Convention sur les armes chimiques. On ne peut ignorer le fait que les Syriens continuent à coopérer de bonne foi avec l’OIAC, a argué la délégation. Un avis partagé par les membres africains du Conseil (Algérie, Mozambique, Sierra Léone), qui se sont félicités d’une « coopération fructueuse », tout en encourageant les parties à poursuivre sur cette voie pour clore le dossier de manière durable.\\n\\nElle aussi favorable à cette coopération, la Chine a cependant invité l’OIAC à la neutralité, l’appelant à veiller à ce que ses enquêtes garantissent la viabilité des preuves et la crédibilité de ses conclusions afin de préserver la nature technique de ses travaux.\\n\\n**La Syrie appelée à fournir des réponses plausibles et vérifiables**\\n\\nCes arguments ont été battus en brèche par plusieurs autres membres du Conseil. Après 28 cycles de consultations entre l’Équipe d’évaluation des déclarations et l’autorité nationale syrienne, les questions en suspens ne portent pas sur des points de forme ou de procédure, a insisté la France. Si la Syrie veut retrouver ses droits et privilèges en tant qu’État partie à la Convention, elle doit fournir des réponses vérifiables et scientifiquement plausibles, tout en remplissant ses obligations vis-à-vis des résolutions de ce Conseil, a plaidé la Suisse.\\n\\nReplaçant le dossier des armes chimiques syriennes dans le contexte de l’escalade en cours dans le nord-ouest de la Syrie, le Royaume-Uni a, pour sa part, relevé que, d’après des enquêtes internationales indépendantes, la Syrie aurait utilisé ce type d’armes au moins à 38 reprises depuis 2013. « Alors que les tensions restent vives au Moyen-Orient, les armes chimiques non déclarées de la Syrie représentent un risque inacceptable. » Dans la même veine, les États-Unis ont martelé que le programme d’armes chimiques de la Syrie n’est pas « une relique du passé » mais bien une menace pour la paix et la sécurité internationales. « Il ne peut pas y avoir d’impunité pour ceux qui utilisent ces armes », ont-ils fait valoir.\\n\\nÀ son tour, la Türkiye, invitée par le Conseil, a déploré que Damas persiste à ne pas fournir un compte rendu complet et transparent de son programme d’armes chimiques. Au-delà des réponses attendues aux questions en suspens, elle a souhaité que l’élimination des armes chimiques syriennes s’accompagne d’un engagement réel à faire avancer le processus politique dans le pays.\\n\\n**Preuves irréfutables sur l’emploi d’armes chimiques**\\n\\nDans ce climat tendu, la Fédération de Russie et la Syrie ont toutes deux critiqué le choix des intervenants de la société civile effectué par la présidence américaine du Conseil, y compris lors des deux dernières séances qui portaient sur la Syrie et sur les conséquences de la guerre en Ukraine sur les enfants. La délégation russe a dénoncé les interventions de « propagandistes », qui n’apportent rien au débat et « transforment le Conseil en cirque ».\\n\\nCette prise de position n’a pas empêché le Directeur général du Centre de documentation des violations chimiques de la Syrie de s’exprimer ce matin devant le Conseil. Il a indiqué que son organisme a recensé pas moins de 20 occurrences d’emploi d’armes chimiques en Syrie, pour un bilan évalué à plus de 14 000 morts parmi les civils. Les preuves sur l’utilisation d’armes chimiques sont selon lui irréfutables. « Nous avons identifié les responsables et reconstitué la chaîne de commandement », a-t-il souligné, indiquant que l’objectif poursuivi par le Centre de documentation est de garantir les droits des victimes et de renforcer les capacités des États parties à mettre en œuvre la Convention sur les armes chimiques.\\n\\nAlors que le monde a célébré, voilà cinq jours, la Journée annuelle du souvenir dédiée à toutes les victimes de la guerre chimique, Mme Nakamitsu a appelé la communauté internationale à réaffirmer son engagement en faveur de la Convention, à mettre fin à l’impunité et à respecter l’engagement du Pacte pour l’avenir en faveur d’un monde exempt de telles armes.

L’Équipe d’évaluation des déclarations de l’Organisation pour l’interdiction des armes chimiques (OIAC) a poursuivi ses efforts pour clarifier toutes les questions en suspens concernant la déclaration initiale et les déclarations ultérieures soumises par Damas. Le vingt-huitième cycle de consultations et de réunions techniques entre l’Équipe d’évaluation des déclarations et l’autorité nationale syrienne a eu lieu entre le 10 et le 18 septembre 2024, a indiqué la haute fonctionnaire de l’ONU. À la date du présent rapport, l’Équipe continue d’analyser les informations recueillies à cette occasion à partir des documents soumis par l’autorité nationale syrienne. Par une note verbale du 11 novembre 2024, l’autorité nationale syrienne a fourni des explications sur les résultats de l’analyse des échantillons prélevés en mai 2024, que l’Équipe examine actuellement. Par une autre note verbale datée du 1er novembre 2024, l’Équipe d’évaluation a demandé à l’autorité nationale syrienne d’identifier au plus tôt, parmi les plus de 1 000 pages d’informations soumises lors du vingt-huitième cycle de consultations, les éléments en rapport avec les explications qu’elle avait fournies, afin de progresser dans la résolution des questions en suspens, une demande à laquelle le Secrétariat technique de l’OIAC n’a pas reçu de réponse au moment de la rédaction du dernier rapport.\\n\\nMme Nakamitsu a rappelé qu’à ce jour, l’Équipe d’évaluation a identifié 26 questions en suspens concernant la déclaration de la Syrie, dont 19 irrésolues. Il s’agit notamment de celles récemment ouvertes concernant le développement et la production à grande échelle d’armes chimiques, potentiellement non déclarés, dans deux installations qui avaient été déclarées précédemment comme n’ayant jamais été en activité. La substance des 19 questions en suspens reste « très préoccupante », a concédé Mme Nakamitsu, parce qu’elles concernent de grandes quantités d’agents de guerre chimique et de munitions qui auraient été détruites ou consommées d’une autre manière avant l’adhésion de la Syrie à la Convention sur les armes chimiques, a expliqué la Haute-Représentante, et dont le sort ne peut être entièrement vérifié par l’OIAC. Il s’agit également de quantités potentiellement importantes d’agents de guerre chimique dont la production n’a pas été déclarée par la Syrie au Secrétariat technique de l’OIAC. La haute fonctionnaire a dit attendre le rapport du Secrétariat technique sur les inspections des installations de Barzé et Jamrayé du Centre d’études et de recherches scientifiques, qui ont eu lieu du 12 au 20 novembre 2024.\\n\\nAprès avoir assuré à nouveau que le Secrétariat technique reste pleinement engagé à vérifier le respect par la Syrie de ses obligations en vertu de la Convention, des décisions des organes de l’OIAC et des résolutions du Conseil de sécurité, Mme Nakamitsu a souligné que la pleine coopération de la Syrie avec le Secrétariat technique est essentielle pour résoudre toutes les questions en suspens. Compte tenu des lacunes, des incohérences et des divergences identifiées et non résolues, le Secrétariat technique estime que la déclaration soumise par la Syrie ne peut toujours pas être considérée comme exacte et complète au regard de la Convention sur les armes chimiques. Elle l’a donc invitée à coopérer avec le Secrétariat technique et à répondre d’urgence à toutes ses demandes.\\n\\nAlors que le monde a célébré la Journée annuelle du souvenir dédiée à toutes les victimes de la guerre chimique la semaine dernière, la Haute-Représentante a appelé la communauté internationale à réaffirmer son engagement en faveur de la Convention, à mettre fin à l’impunité et à respecter l’engagement du Pacte pour l’avenir en faveur d’un monde exempt de telles armes. Elle a enfin exhorté les membres du Conseil de sécurité à s’unir et à faire preuve de leadership en démontrant que toute utilisation d’armes chimiques est inacceptable.\\n\\nM. NIDAL SHIKHANI, Directeur général du Centre de documentation des violations chimiques de la Syrie, a dénoncé le terrifiant usage d’armes chimiques en République arabe syrienne, qui a plongé les habitants du pays dans un « enfer » et entraîné un « conflit politique et juridique » qui empêche d’éliminer totalement des arsenaux représentant toujours un péril de taille pour la paix et la sécurité internationales. Selon l’intervenant, plus de 20 occurrences d’emploi d’armes ont été recensées par le Centre. Il a également fait état de la mort de plus de 14 000 civils et rappelé les malformations à la naissance et les traumatismes psychologiques engendrés par ces armes, avant de saluer les efforts de l’OIAC depuis le début de sa mission en Syrie. Les preuves sur l’utilisation d’armes chimiques sont selon lui irréfutables. « Nous avons identifié les responsables et reconstitué la chaîne de commandement », a-t-il souligné, indiquant que l’objectif poursuivi par son organisme est de garantir les droits des victimes et de renforcer les capacités des États parties à mettre en œuvre la Convention sur les armes chimiques.\\n\\nM. Shikhani a précisé qu’à la suite de l’adoption par le Conseil de la résolution 2118 (2013) sur l’élimination des arsenaux d’armes chimiques de la Syrie et la destruction de ses stocks, du chlore a été utilisé à plusieurs reprises et dans plusieurs lieux pendant cinq ans. Cet emploi, a-t-il dit, coïncidait avec les stocks déclarés de la Syrie. Accusant les autorités syriennes de manipuler l’OIAC et de faire preuve d’obstruction, il a estimé que leur déclaration ne peut être considérée comme exacte et complète. À ses yeux, l’opacité entourant les stocks syriens exige une action internationale urgente et ferme afin de garantir que le monde soit exempt d’armes de destruction massive. Pour l’intervenant, il importe également que les pays qui appuient le « régime syrien terroriste » cessent de le protéger. Il faut appliquer le principe de responsabilité et mettre un terme à l’impunité, a-t-il plaidé, appelant à la création d’une entité internationale indépendante et impartiale pour faire rendre des comptes aux auteurs de ces violations.\\n\\n[Syrie](https://press.un.org/fr/syrie)\\n\\n**À l’intention des organes d’information.

In coordination with the Salvation National Army (SNA) ‘Dawn of Freedom’ operation, the two major opposition groups have seized control of at least 237 cities, towns, villages, and military bases from the GoS.

Healthcare facilities are under immense strain, with many hospitals closed or only offering emergency services. Public health concerns include the risk of waterborne diseases resulting from poor sanitation. Lack of security and funding limitations are challenging efforts to restore clean water in Aleppo. Protection services, including support for gender-based violence (GBV) victims and child protection, are severely limited as a result of funding gaps and facility closures.

More than 473,000 Syrians displaced from Lebanon, along with Lebanese refugees, have entered the country since 24 September 2024. This influx of people, 58 per cent of them children, puts further pressure on the already overstretched resources and services in the Syrian Arab Republic. Affected people require integrated lifesaving interventions, early recovery efforts and protection measures across the country, including in the northwest and the northeast.\\n\\nThe 2023 earthquakes aggravated people's longstanding vulnerabilities. Despite a significant humanitarian response, access to services, adequate infrastructure and economic inclusion are still challenging. Some 7.2 million people are internally displaced, with 2 million of them living in mostly overcrowded camps and 5.2 million living outside of camps. Among those people who are internally displaced, 3.4 million16 are in the northwest.\\n\\nEighty-five percent of households struggle to make ends meet, increasing their reliance on aid and such negative coping mechanisms as child labour and suboptimal diets. Almost 40 per cent of hospitals and health facilities are either non-functional or only partially functional,18 while climate-induced shocks and power supply disruptions have intensified water scarcity and food insecurity.

She called on Syria to cooperate with the Technical Secretariat and respond with urgency to all of its requests and urged Council members to “unite and show leadership in demonstrating that any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable”.\\n\\n“Chemical weapons have turned the lives of Syrians into hell,” said Nidal Shikhani, Director General of the Chemical Violations Documentation Center of Syria, reporting that his organization has recorded “262 chemical weapons uses” which have killed 3,423 and injured around 14,000 civilians. The use of such weapons has led to deformed childbirths and psychological trauma to the victims, the death of animals and the destruction of soil.\\n\\nNoting his organization’s provision of support to OPCW and its investigative teams, he said its gathering of “thousands of documented evidence which cannot be challenged” aimed to prove that “chemical weapons were used for hostile purposes”. Moreover, its work to identify those involved and the chain of command contributed to ensuring the rights of victims and strengthening the capacity of State parties to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention.\\n\\n“Chlorine was used in different occasions and locations, and it continued for five years,” he said, adding that serine used in “Douma and Al-Lataminah” matched the declared Syrian stock. “Such violations prove the continued manipulation of the Syrian Arab Republic with OPCW”, he stressed, criticizing Syria for its “policy of procrastination” and non-fulfilment of its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Council resolutions.\\n\\nHe called for urgent and firm international action to address chemical weapons issues and urged the Council to “think outside the box and adopt new strategies”. He further called on countries supporting the Syrian regime to stop protecting it and stressed that an independent judicial entity with a global mandate must be established to hold accountable those involved in the use of chemical weapons.\\n\\nIn the ensuing debate, delegates once again voiced concern about the lack of progress on the chemical weapons file and called on Syria to cooperate with OPCW. They also voiced concern about the deteriorating security situation in the country and underscored the urgency of resolving the outstanding issues.\\n\\nA few speakers, however, questioned the impartiality of OPCW’s work and the presence of today’s civil society briefer, as well as others in recent Council briefings, whom they said are invited to advance the interests of the United States. Among them was the Russian Federation’s representative who also averred that today’s debate featured nothing “fundamentally new”, with the OPCW Secretariat complying with the West’s orders “to taint Syria and its allies”. However, OPCW continues to ignore Syria’s efforts to cooperate, despite being stripped of its rights under the Chemical Weapons Convention, he said, underscoring that, in the past 11 years, 150 technical meetings had been held, 45 site visits conducted and 180 samples taken. Syria’s good faith efforts are always insufficient for the West. He went on to characterize the United States delegation as “lame ducks” striving in the last month to cement the priorities of the outgoing administration of \\\\[President Joseph R.\\\\] Biden, including its anti-Syria policies, which OPCW is complicit in — in New York and The Hague.\\n\\nHowever, the delegate of the United States, Council President for December, spoke in his national capacity and stressed that “the Security Council must remain seized of the Syrian chemical weapons dossier” — a point echoed later by Japan’s representative. He further warned that it is in situations like the one unfolding in Syria today — “when the Assad regime feels most at risk” — when it previously unleashed chemical weapons on its people. He called on all Member States to implement without delay the recommended collective measures called for in the decision by the OPCW Conference of the States Parties in 2023, including those aiming to prevent the transfer to Syria of certain dual-use chemicals and equipment. His Russian counterpart’s statement was “right out of the Russian playbook” to refute the legitimacy of international bodies’ findings. Pointing to the efforts of a very small group of States who prefer to hide the truth about the Assad regime’s repeated use of chemical weapons against its people, he stressed: “The perpetrators of these acts will not be able to hide. They will be held accountable.”\\n\\n“It is past time for the regime to comply with its obligations under Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), cooperate with the OPCW Technical Secretariat and fully declare its chemical weapons programme. Only then can we consign Syrian chemical weapons to history,” underscored the United Kingdom’s delegate in agreement. Amid high tensions in the Middle East, “Syria’s undeclared chemical weapons are an unacceptable risk,” she stressed.\\n\\nSlovenia’s delegate, highlighting the unfolding situation in Aleppo, said that chemical weapons have been used in that city before. “The world is watching and so must this Council,” she added. The Republic of Korea’s representative added that the lack of Syria’s full verification of its declaration “leaves substantial quantities of chemical weapons unaccounted for, posing a significant threat to regional and global security as territorial losses quickly exacerbate the power vacuum”.\\n\\nSeveral other delegations, including France and Japan, also called on Damascus to cooperate. Switzerland’s representative appealed for “verifiable and scientifically plausible answers” to outstanding issues and rejected any attempts to discredit OPCW’s work. Malta’s representative said that Syria has continued to obstruct the work of OPCW, including by denying access to some of its personnel and by delaying the process. Ecuador’s delegate, expressing concern that OPCW’s findings point to the use of chemical weapons by both State and non-State actors, called for thorough and impartial investigations to ensure that those responsible face the consequences of their actions.\\n\\n“Damascus continues to fail to provide a full and transparent account of its chemical weapons programme,” echoed Türkiye’s speaker later in the meeting, recalling that his delegation co-sponsored the decision on Syria taken at the twenty-eighth session of the OPCW Conference of the States Parties. Theelimination of chemical weapons must be accompanied by a genuine commitment to advancing Syria’s political process, and a national reconciliation based on justice and inclusivity, he stressed.\\n\\nSeveral delegations, however, voiced support for Syria’s constructive engagement. Algeria’s delegate, also speaking for Guyana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone, welcomed progress achieved by Syria, noting that “in terms of the overall figure for destruction, 100 per cent of declared chemical weapons had been destroyed \\\\[as\\\\] of 7 July 2023”. Commending the ongoing collaboration between that country and the Technical Secretariat, he said the continuation of this successful cooperation is necessary to close this file permanently.\\n\\nChina’s delegate, similarly, welcomed the twenty‑eighth round of consultations between Damascus and OPCW in September and encouraged both parties to resolve outstanding issues through mutual cooperation. Echoing concerns about today’s second briefer, he voiced hope that arrangements will be made through consensus going forward. Iran’s delegate underlined the need for OPCW’s impartiality and its “non-discriminatory implementation” of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and spotlighted Syria’s compliance “having destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities”. Noting Israel’s use of phosphorus bombs against civilians in Gaza and southern Lebanon, he stressed that such acts call for the Council’s condemnation, and for an investigation by OPCW.\\n\\n“Syria has fulfilled all its obligations according to the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroyed fully its stockpile of chemical weapons and production facilities,” declared Syria’s representative, detailing its cooperation with OPCW, including the extension of the Tripartite Agreement between Syria, OPCW and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) for an additional six months as of 31 December. He echoed the Russian Federation’s concern about the objectivity of the Council’s briefers and, noting that OPCW’s monthly reports continue “to politicize accusations against my country” in line with Western countries’ views, said the Technical Secretariat disregarded Syria’s cooperation and rushed to raise two new issues in July. The politicization of OPCW disregards real threats to regional peace and security and to the non-proliferation regime, he warned, pointing to Israel’s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Everything promoted by the United States and its allies is part of its attempts to manipulate this file using an unprofessional and biased approach. He reiterated his demand that the Technical Secretariat adopt a neutral, objective and professional approach to allow the immediate resolution of all pending matters and to stop the political manipulation of the file and close it permanently.\\n\\n***NEW – Follow real-time meetings coverage on our*** [***LIVE blog***](https://press.un.org/en/live)***.***\\n\\n[Syria](https://press.un.org/en/syria)\\n\\n[Disarmament](https://press.un.org/en/disarmament)\\n\\n**For information media.

Figures are still being reconciled, noting that UNHR and NGOs operating in the northeastern part of Syria estimate that between 60,000 and 80,000 people have been newly displaced there, including more than 25,000 currently hosted in collective centers.\\n- Public services and critical facilities in Aleppo are either disrupted or non-functional due to shortages of supplies and personnel.\\n- The escalation of violence has severely impacted the local healthcare system, leading to the suspension of operations at key health facilities in Aleppo and Idleb.\\n- In the northeast, not only collective centers are filling up as soon as they’re assigned, reception centers are at capacity and in below freezing temperatures, people are sleeping on the streets and in their cars. Assessments are ongoing to identify the needs of newly arrived families.\\n- Although the exact number of casualties remains to be confirmed, hundreds of civilians are estimated to have lost their lives or got injured during the past 7 days. It is reported that at least 69 civilians have been killed, including 26 children and 11 women, with more than 200 injured, primarily in north-west Syria. Also, over 370 civilians reported killed in Hama due to ongoing clashes.\\n\\n**SITUATION OVERVIEW**\\n\\nThe security situation in Syria remains highly concerning, with intensifying hostilities, particularly in the northern and northwestern regions. Since late November 2024, hostilities in Aleppo, Idleb, and Hama Governorates have escalated resulting in widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and severely constrained access to and availability of essential services for affected communities, especially those trapped near the frontlines.\\n\\nOngoing active hostilities in Aleppo, Idleb and Hama Governorates since 27 November have resulted in territorial control changes in different locations in the afore mentioned governorates. Thousands of affected people continue to flee areas and seek refuge in safer locations within the affected governorates and in other governorates. Thousands have temporarily relocated to Northeast Syria (NES), through the Tabqa and Bu Assi crossing points.\\n\\nBy early December, at least 69 civilians had reportedly been killed, including 26 children and 11 women, with more than 200 injured, primarily in Northwest Syria (NWS). In Aleppo, civilian deaths and injuries have been reported in Alleramoon, Al-Sakhour, and Ash-Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhoods. The exact number of casualties remains unverified. The escalation in hostilities has also led to significant damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Aleppo. In Homs and Hama Governorates, the humanitarian situation remains dire, with over 370 civilians reported killed in Hama.\\n\\nIn Homs, the displacement of thousands of families from highly affected Governorates (Aleppo, Idleb, and Hama) has strained shelters and humanitarian assets. While efforts are underway to rehabilitate shelters in both Governorates, the infrastructure supporting IDPs remains inadequate. In Hama, some shelters have been temporarily opened and then closed, creating uncertainty around shelter availability. Shortages of basic necessities are reported, including food, hygiene kits, and medical support, coupled with the destruction of civilian infrastructure, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in both areas.\\n\\nAs of 5 December, an estimated total of 178,000 people have been displaced due to the recent escalations in northern Syria, including 128,000 newly displaced and 39,000 displaced at least twice. Approximately 15,400 people have moved from Tall Refaat area to Menbij (Aleppo), while most of the population has moved from Idleb sub-districts. In Tabqa, NES, 35 buildings were assigned to host IDPs. The situation in Ar-Raqqa is chaotic, despite having more than 70 buildings assigned as temporary collective centres, the displacement wave is beyond the capacity to accommodate forcing people to sleep on the streets and in their cars As of 4 December, four new reception sites were established in Ain Al-Arab, Al-Hasakeh and Qamishli Cities with more than 400 families already hosted there.', original_date='2024-12-05T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

       " ReliefArticle(title='Syria’s North-western Front Erupts', body='*Rebels have captured Aleppo, the country’s second most significant city, abruptly throwing the Syrian government on the back foot. In this Q&A, Crisis Group experts explain what has happened and how the various parties to Syria’s conflict may react.*\\n\\n## What is happening?\\n\\nSyria’s civil war, which has been largely frozen for over four years, has erupted again in startling fashion. Rebels who control Idlib province and adjacent parts of north-western Syria broke through the Syrian army’s lines, driving east, capturing Aleppo, the country’s second city, and cutting the crucial M5 highway connecting it to the capital Damascus in a matter of days.\\n\\nThe offensive has overturned a delicate set of arrangements that had kept fighting in the north west fairly quiet since 2020, when Russia and Türkiye struck a ceasefire deal that froze the front lines. That ceasefire, which covered actions by Syrian government forces and its allied militias, on one side, and rebels, on the other, had largely held despite frequent shelling across the front. The relative calm allowed Hei’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel group, to assert dominance in Idlib, ensconce itself as a military force and establish a civilian government it backed, the Syrian Salvation Government. HTS has also indirectly benefited from the support Türkiye has extended to the Syrian National Army (SNA), an umbrella group comprising several other rebel factions.\\n\\nThe speed of the rebels’ advance is surprising, but the fact that they attacked is not. HTS – a former al-Qaeda affiliate that broke with the global movement in 2016 and swore off transnational jihadism – has never wavered from its goal, which it shares with other rebels, of ending President Bashar al-Assad’s rule. Even as it focused on governing territory under its control, it was waiting for the right opportunity to gain ground. Since 2020, when major combat on the north-western front paused, it has been building up its forces with the help of defected Syrian military officers who have improved its fighters’ skills, its units’ command-and-control and its general coordination. HTS and associated groups are more organised, more disciplined and better equipped than before. They have also been using new weaponry, particularly drones, as a force multiplier.\\n\\n*The rebels’ opportunity arrived due to a chain of events that have chipped away at the Syrian government’s strength on the ground.*\\n\\nThe rebels’ opportunity arrived due to a chain of events that have chipped away at the Syrian government’s strength on the ground. Since 2022, when it launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine, Russia has diverted its attention from Syria to concentrate its forces in the battle with Kyiv. The next links were Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, the subsequent war between Israel and members of the Iran-led “axis of resistance”, and the heavy blows that Iran and Hizbollah in Lebanon, in particular, have suffered in the past few months. Hizbollah, whose fighters are known for their professionalism and ability to hold lines, and other Iran-backed militants have long deployed troops in the north west and elsewhere to aid the Syrian government. Since 7 October 2023, and particularly following the escalation of the war in Lebanon in the past few months, these forces have been under pressure due to near-daily Israeli strikes on Iranian and Hizbollah targets in Syria. Together, these developments have meant that the government’s foreign allies, which had safeguarded its survival for the past decade, are either weakened or preoccupied elsewhere.\\n\\nAleppo was also something of a soft target. Rebel elements originally took over parts of the city in 2012. Since 2016, when the Syrian army and allied militias recaptured Aleppo with Russian and Iranian support, the government has done little to bolster the city’s defences. Pro-government forces remained fragmented, with [militias in particular pursuing pecuniary gain](https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria/syria-ruling-over-aleppos-ruins) rather than building the government’s military capabilities. The army and affiliated militias did not have a joint operations room during the rebel offensive, which left them fighting independently, exposing their poor coordination in the face of the rebel forces’ new tactics.\\n\\n## What explains the government’s ineffective response?\\n\\nClearly diminished support from Hizbollah, other Iran-backed groups and Russia, which has given only limited air support, has mattered. Most of all, though, the rebel offensive exposed vulnerabilities in government defences, which collapsed all along the front, with soldiers and other pro-government forces fleeing rather than putting up a fight. With little integration between infantry and artillery units, not to speak of the air force, the army had little close-range fire support. Mobile HTS assault teams exploited these gaps to overwhelm defensive positions. The rout in Aleppo was particularly shocking, given that during the war to date the government has been bent on holding major cities at any cost. Despite the defender’s advantages in urban terrain and the arrival of reinforcements, such as the army’s 25th Division and the Republican Guard, Syrian forces barely defended strategic positions, including the Citadel, the medieval fort on a hill overlooking the city. (During the 2016 fighting, the Citadel was a crucial defensive point for government forces even when rebels controlled much of eastern Aleppo.)\\n\\nDespite having expected some form of rebel offensive for months, Damascus was caught off guard by the rebels’ swift progress. Alongside Russia, it had been conducting pre-emptive airstrikes on HTS-controlled territory in Idlib and neighbouring areas since October in an attempt to deter a rebel attack. These efforts were clearly in vain. Since the offensive began in late November, pro-government forces have been withdrawing from most of Aleppo provinceand areas in eastern and southern Idlib to southern Aleppo province and Hama province, allowing rebels, who faced little resistance, to seize areas like Aleppo city, Saraqib and Maarat al-Numan. The rebel advances indicate the direction of travel – Damascus – and inevitably raise the question of whether the government will have the capacity to reinforce its combat units and muster resources for a counteroffensive.\\n\\n## Who is fighting?\\n\\nPro-government forces are both Syrian and foreign. They include the army’s 25th Division, the Republican Guard, the army’s 5th Corps; paramilitary units such as the National Defence Forces, Liwa al-Quds and Local Defence Forces; militias affiliated with the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and the Baath Party; the locally important al-Berri clan militia; and Iran-backed groups such as the al-Abbas Brigade. Other Iran-backed groups from outside Syria, including the Afghan Fatemiyoun Brigade and the Pakistani Zainebiyoun Brigade, bolster pro-government ranks.\\n\\nMost of the foreign fighters in government-held areas belong to Iraqi groups such as Harakat al-Nujaba, Kata’ib Sayed al-Shuhada and Kata’ib Hizbollah. They add fighting strength, but they lack the skill that Hizbollah exhibited. Most are stationed close to the Iraqi border, but some have redeployed in support of government forces. Harakat al-Nujaba, for example, which had been around Aleppo, has withdrawn to Hama, a city roughly half the way to Damascus on the M5 highway, to strengthen defensive lines there. Kata’ib Sayed al-Shuhada has reportedly sent additional fighters into Syria, awaiting coordination with Iran and the Syrian government before determining where to deploy. Kata’ib Hizbollah is still reading the landscape, waiting to decide whether to enter the fighting.\\n\\n*Fragmentation has repeatedly hindered the \\\\[Syrian\\\\] government’s ability to coordinate responses to rebel offensives.*\\n\\nIn this array of forces, a central weakness is the lack of unified command. Fragmentation has repeatedly hindered the government’s ability to coordinate responses to rebel offensives. During the 2016 battle for Aleppo, rebels were able to exploit pro-government forces’ disorganisation at first. While the latter eventually prevailed, the rebels initially routed government forces, which suffered territorial losses and high fatalities, similar to those in late November, although on a smaller scale. In the current fighting, the 25th Division has led limited counterattacks, but the absence of a cohesive command structure continues to obstruct decision-making and operational efficiency.\\n\\nThe Syrian Defence Forces (SDF), mostly Kurdish units that hold much of the country’s north east, add a layer of complexity to the situation. The government has often fought the SDF, but it now appears to have struck a tactical deal with the group to defend what is left of the Aleppo districts it recaptured in 2016. Before retreating, government forces handed over areas including Deir Hafer, Maskana, Sheikh Najjar and the international airport to the SDF. Simultaneously, Russia has been aiding the SDF in warding off threats to their domain in the north east from Turkish-backed factions, as Russian airstrikes have hit those factions’ positions in al-Bab and Marea, areas in northern Aleppo province adjacent to SDF-held territory. But whether the SDF can hang on to these areas, which are isolated from its north-eastern strongholds, in the face of the swift rebel advances is uncertain at best.\\n\\nOn the rebel side, apart from HTS, the strongest group, there are several factions. The most structured, such as Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq al-Sham, both of which are Islamist, and smaller non-ideological groups, are in Idlib province. They fight alongside HTS under a unified Military Operations Command. They are joined by the SNA, which includes a range of groups, some of which previously formed the bulk of the Free Syrian Army in areas under Turkish control in the northern Aleppo countryside and Afrin. While they all want to remove the Assad government, they are divided by ideology, personality conflicts and (sometimes) outside support, although HTS has used its dominance in Idlib province since 2019 to curb cross-factional competition there.\\n\\n## What could come next?\\n\\nWhile HTS is trying to solidify control of areas it has seized, pro-government forces are regrouping in and around Hama, which has remained under government control throughout the war. Losing Hama would open the door for the rebels to push farther south, fundamentally altering the war’s trajectory and maybe even threatening the government’s survival. If the government’s defences at Hama hold, the area would likely become the launchpad for its counteroffensive toward Aleppo’s countryside, as it has been in the past, particularly if Iran-backed groups or Russia weigh in more forcefully. Major reinforcements have arrived in the city. If government forces can prepare to push outward from Hama, the question will be what sort of resistance rebels can put up.\\n\\nThe rebel advances are likely to push Damascus closer to Iran and Hizbollah, thus blocking – at least for now – any pathway the Syrian leadership might have had to distance itself from Iran’s axis. Since Syria’s readmittance into the Arab League in May 2023, Damascus has been improving diplomatic ties and discussed economic cooperation with the United Arab Emirates in particular, though the outcome of these discussions remains to be seen. Gulf Arab states have held out economic incentives – which might require them to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Syria – but they would want to see Damascus limit Iranian influence. That now seems an unlikely prospect, given events. In any case, Syria had shown little sign of compromise even before this latest offensive. The extent of any renewed government effort at strengthening the alignment with Iran will depend on whether pro-government forces can quickly halt the rebel advance. If the government succeeds in doing that, with Russian support, it may avoid having to deepen its reliance on Tehran.\\n\\nAs in 2015, when the tide of Syria’s war turned in the government’s favour, Russian support could prove a game changer. Though it has staged several airstrikes during the rebel offensive, Russia’s engagement thus far appears lower than it did prior to the Ukraine war. To compensate for the reduced Russian air support, the government has been firing tactical missiles at HTS command posts and logistical nodes, to little avail. If Russia were to ramp up its involvement, it could slow, halt or even reverse rebel gains. Additional Russian equipment is expected to arrive soon. Civilian flights from the Russian air base at Hmeimem are being diverted to Damascus to make room for more military traffic. In addition to bombing the front lines, Russia will likely aim to destabilise rebel-held areas by targeting civilian sites, making them much more difficult to govern, as well as causing civilian casualties and renewed mass displacement.\\n\\n*Fighting could also escalate between the rebels and Kurdish-led forces.*\\n\\nMeanwhile, fighting could also escalate between the rebels and Kurdish-led forces. The People’s Protection Units (YPG) – the SDF’s backbone that is linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Türkiye – have controlled pockets of Aleppo and the surrounding countryside for years. One flashpoint is Tel Rifaat, a town north of Aleppo. The YPG captured it from rebel forces in 2016 and has subsequently used it as a staging ground for attacks on Turkish forces. Media outlets reported on 1 December that Ankara-backed rebels had driven the YPG out of Tel Rifaat. Another is Sheikh Maqsoud, an Aleppo neighbourhood with a significant Kurdish population. (In a [statement](https://www.rudaw.net/turkish/middleeast/syria/011220248), HTS offered the SDF safe passage out of Aleppo, promising not to harm the city’s Kurdish civilians; tactical deals between HTS and the SDF are also not out of the question.)\\n\\nMuch will also depend on how effectively the rebels govern newly captured territory, assuming they hold it – particularly since Aleppo has a bigger, more diverse population than other areas in their hands. HTS established a governance body in Idlib, known as the Syrian Salvation Government, some years back; it is a rival of the Syrian Interim Government that administers other opposition-held areas in cooperation with Türkiye. As the leading force in the offensive, HTS could put in place a formula in Aleppo that incorporates other political and civil society figures. Senior HTS leaders tell Crisis Group that the group is considering appointing such a body, distinct from governance arrangements in Idlib. That might make its rule more palatable for both the local population and outside powers that have kept HTS at arm’s length. It could mitigate the implications of HTS’s terrorist designation, allow in foreign aid and help facilitate IDP returns.\\n\\nThe Salvation Government has asked Idlib-based NGOs, including international ones, to move to Aleppo, and its ministry of development and humanitarian affairs announced plans to open an office in the city on 2 December. It reportedly has also established checkpoints in the city and restored electricity. The group also emphasised its commitment to safeguarding foreign consulates and protecting religious minorities. Still, HTS’s history and ideological roots mean it will struggle to address many Syrians’ concerns about living under its rule and the implications for their personal and religious freedoms.\\n\\n## What are the implications of these events for the various actors involved?\\n\\nFor the Syrian government, the loss of Aleppo to the rebels is a major blow. Aleppo is not just a big city; it is a symbol of the government’s victory in the civil war, with its recapture in 2016 serving as a defining triumph for Damascus and its allies. Losing it now upends that narrative: the government will now have more difficulty casting itself as capable of holding onto Syria’s heartland without heavy reliance on foreign support. To the contrary, Aleppo’s rapid fall reinforces perceptions that the government’s survival hinges on Iranian and Russian backing. With this setback, Damascus may lose credibility among countries seeking to normalise relations, such as Gulf Arab states. That said, the opposite may also occur: the UAE and Jordan, which fear the prospect of Islamists seizing power in Syria, have spoken up in support of the government. Thus far, events appear to have reinforced rather than reduced their motivation to forge ties with Damascus anew.\\n\\nFor HTS, military success also changes the prevailing narrative. It is no longer a force hidden away in a corner of Syria, largely unnoticed by the outside world. The fact that HTS – a group designated a terrorist organisation by the UN, the U.S., the EU and Türkiye – ruled Idlib and its environs was not particularly objectionable abroad. Now that could change, and HTS will face a real challenge. Its rule in Aleppo cannot be a mirror image of how it has governed Idlib, given Aleppo’s size and the diversity of its population. Syrians will watch closely. Will there be chaos? Can HTS be more inclusive of other groups and of minorities? If it fails, it will be judged harshly. If it succeeds, other countries, including in Europe, may start feeling pressure to deal directly with HTS.\\n\\nFor Russia, Syria had been a success story, a demonstration of its ability to influence events in the Middle East. Moscow has invested significant time and effort in Syria since 2015, and it will therefore do what it can to prevent the government’s collapse. Amid the war in Ukraine, defeat in Syria or even wider rebel gains would be a blow to the Kremlin’s credibility and a victory for its adversaries. The offensive has thus opened a new front for Russia, one that will demand additional weapons and resources. But the war in Ukraine complicates any move to resupply by sea, as Türkiye is blocking Russian warships from transiting the Bosphorus and Dardanelles (under Article 19 of the Montreux Convention, which stipulates that during a war in which Türkiye is not involved, warships of the belligerent parties are prohibited from using these maritime channels except when returning to base). Moscow and Ankara could wind up at loggerheads. If, as Russian media outlets suggest, Russia concludes that Türkiye is backing efforts to put the government in Damascus on the back foot, it may seek to strike deep within rebel-held areas to trigger new waves of refugees heading toward the Turkish border.\\n\\nAs for Türkiye, fearing just such a scenario, it had reportedly urged rebels, including HTS, not to launch an offensive, in large part because it feared that Russian-backed retaliatory strikes [could send hundreds of thousands of Syrians toward the Turkish border](https://www.cnnturk.com/dunya/bakan-fidandan-suriye-aciklamasi-halepte-yasanan-catismalara-turkiye-mudahil-degil-2194517). Turkish officials say HTS had signalled to Ankara that it would respond to the uptick in strikes by pro-government forces in Idlib. They also say Ankara had raised the issue with Russia and Iran. Neither, however, was inclined to rein in pro-government forces. Still, if Ankara knew a rebel offensive might be on the cards, it does not appear to have explicitly greenlit the campaign and, in any case, it probably could not have anticipated such rapid opposition gains; indeed, even the HTS leadership probably did not foresee such a rapid retreat by pro-government forces.\\n\\n*Ankara may now feel that Assad could be more inclined to negotiate with the opposition for a lasting settlement of the Syria quagmire.*\\n\\nAt the same time, Türkiye could benefit from the rebel’s offensive. The expansion of their area of control would enlarge Ankara’s sphere of influence at the expense of an Assad government backed by Moscow and Tehran, with which it competes for regional influence. Moreover, Ankara may hope that expanded rebel control of the north could open opportunities to send back Syrian refugees currently in Türkiye. Importantly, Syria-Türkiye rapprochement talks have stalled. Ankara may now feel that Assad could be more inclined to negotiate with the opposition for a lasting settlement of the Syria quagmire.\\n\\nThe SDF/YPG has reason to be concerned, because Türkiye and the Türkiye-backed rebels – and to a lesser extent HTS – see the group as aligned with Damascus. Ankara cites evidence from the past few days, and stretching back to the civil war’s onset, that government forces arranged with the YPG to occupy areas they had vacated due to the need to deploy elsewhere. The understanding has invariably been that the YPG would be a temporary custodian; the authorities in Damascus are adamantly opposed to any notion of Kurdish autonomy. Türkiye – in conjunction with the SNA – may see an opportunity to push back the YPG from areas it holds in northern Syria based on its view that the YPG is a branch of the PKK, which it has designated a terrorist organisation.\\n\\nIn Tehran, events in Syria are cause for significant alarm. Speaking with his Syrian counterpart as rebel forces gained ground in Aleppo (killing an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general), Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s Foreign Minister, framed the offensive as part of a U.S.-Israeli plot. He pledged Tehran’s support for an ally on whose survival it has already expended significant blood and treasure. The Islamic Republic is keen not only to preserve the Assad government, one of its few allies, but to maintain a conduit for transferring military assistance to Hizbollah, whose need for that aid has become more dire. If Damascus’s grip starts slipping in places beyond Aleppo, and rebel gains disrupt the Iranian arms pipeline to Hizbollah (which Israel already strikes frequently), Tehran would likely feel it has to jump into the breach. Still, at a time when its vulnerabilities have been laid bare on several fronts, including on its home soil, and given the loss of several Revolutionary Guard commanders in the area, Tehran would have to grapple with whether and how to prevent the fall of a pivotal ally in its “forward defence” strategy on a front that until recently seemed assured.\\n\\nFor Hizbollah, the offensive’s implications appear limited for now. The group remains focused on its war with Israel and had already withdrawn most of its fighters from north-western Syria. But if the Syrian rebels advance further in Hama, the group’s logistics routes could come under threat, posing challenges to its operations in the longer term. It would seek to reverse the situation in close cooperation with Iran.\\n\\n*Washington seems to prefer staying on the sidelines.*\\n\\nFinally, Washington seems to prefer staying on the sidelines – and not just because of the pending change in presidential administrations. The administration is concerned about developments that could trigger widespread civilian suffering and broader regional instability. The potential use of chemical weapons by an Assad government pushed further on the defensive is also on the administration’s radar. Still, the U.S. has higher priorities than Syria in the Middle East. As a U.S. official noted, “What’s happening is not about us”. Moreover, despite its longstanding opposition to the Assad government and its earlier involvement backing rebel groups during the Syrian civil war, the Biden administration is wary of HTS, which remains a U.S.-designated terrorist group. As such, the Biden administration does not believe it has obvious policy options for advancing its interests.\\n\\nNonetheless, the U.S. has been in communication with Ankara about potential lines of conflict between Turkish-backed rebel groups and the SDF, which could upset longstanding U.S.-backed arrangements in north-eastern Syria. Further Turkish-backed advances against the SDF could prompt calls for the U.S. to become more actively involved to protect its Kurdish partners. The U.S. has [emphasised](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3982254/pentagon-press-secretary-maj-gen-pat-ryder-holds-an-off-camera-on-the-record-pr/) that it is prepared to “defend and protect” its personnel and assets in Syria, where around 900 U.S. forces are deployed, as part of its counter-ISIS mission.', original_date='2024-12-05T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

It is estimated that between September and the end of November, approximately 562,000 individuals crossed from Lebanon into Syria, with an estimated 63% of them being Syrians1. However, the displacement dynamics changed rapidly on November 28th. Following the ceasefire in Lebanon, there was a notable increase in immediate departures, with 30,000 Lebanese individuals leaving Syria2. In parallel, the escalation of hostilities in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama quickly altered internal displacement patterns within Syria leading to rapid escalation of the displacement situation. Hama and Homs are facing a critical humanitarian situation with the opening of new hosting centres, quickly exceeding capacity with more than reported 10,870 individuals. Rural Damascus has also faced a rapid influx of arrivals with more than 7,000 arriving in Set Zainab, and Herjellah hosting centre reaching its capacity of 2,500 occupants.\\n\\n**Changing Displacement Patterns**\\n\\nHostilities in Syria have rapidly intensified as the Non-State Armed Group (NSAG), Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), launched a large-scale military operation in the north. By November 29, HTS had captured Aleppo city and moved southward, reaching Hama by November 30. On December 1st, reports indicated that the Khanaser-Atharaya road—an essential route for internally displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing Aleppo—was cut off. This situation has made it difficult for those fleeing from rural areas to reach the city, rendering them difficult to access. While Hama city remains under the control of the Syrian government, fighting continues. The situation is highly volatile, resulting in continuous population displacement and a high likelihood of further escalation and worsening humanitarian conditions. The areas most affected by the clashes are likely to experience significant outflows toward government-controlled territories and the countryside, with the most probable direction of displacement being towards urban centres in government-controlled regions.

Geir Otto Pedersen, lors de cette séance demandée par la Fédération de Russie, la Chine et les A3+ -Algérie, Mozambique, Sierra Leone et Guyane. Si entre-temps, a précisé le haut fonctionnaire, les forces gouvernementales syriennes se sont regroupées et ont établi des lignes défensives, « au moment où je vous parle, celles-ci sont mises à rude épreuve ». HTS et les groupes d’opposition armés gagnent du terrain, avancent au plus près de Hama, une grande ville d’environ un million d’habitants, a mis en garde le haut fonctionnaire.\\n\\nParallèlement, a poursuivi M. Pedersen, la violence a éclaté sur un deuxième front, avec le lancement par l’Armée nationale syrienne d’une opération le 30 novembre sur Tell Rifaat, une poche au nord d’Alep placée sous le contrôle de facto des forces affiliées aux Forces démocratiques syriennes (FDS). En réponse, les FDS déployées dans le nord-est de la Syrie se sont rapidement déplacées pour se connecter à ces poches. L’Armée nationale syrienne a désormais largement vaincu ces forces dans ces zones, avec une évacuation à grande échelle de combattants et de dizaines de milliers de civils vers le nord-est de la Syrie, a indiqué M. Pedersen.\\n\\nPour le délégué syrien, l’ampleur et la portée de l’attaque menée par ces organisations terroristes démontrent sans équivoque l’étendue du soutien qui leur est apporté par des acteurs régionaux et internationaux, qui ont instrumentalisé le terrorisme comme un outil de leur politique étrangère contre Damas. « Elle n’aurait pu être menée sans le feu vert conjoint turco-israélien », a-t-il accusé. De son côté, la Fédération de Russie, qui a reconnu prêter à la Syrie un renfort aérien, a largement imputé la responsabilité de l’escalade récente aux États-Unis et à leurs alliés, qui soutiendraient les terroristes, suivie sur ce point par la République islamique d’Iran. Une allégation balayée par la délégation américaine, qui a rappelé que Washington considère HTS comme une organisation terroriste.\\n\\nEn début de séance, la délégation russe, scandalisée par l’invitation faite à une « ONG odieuse », a demandé que la participation du Directeur des Casques blancs à cette séance soit mise aux voix. Grâce à 11 voix pour, 2 contre (Chine et Fédération de Russie) et 2 abstentions (Algérie et Mozambique), M. Raed Al Saleh a pu s’exprimer au cours de cette séance, revêtu de l’uniforme permettant d’identifier sur le terrain les membres de cette organisation humanitaire de protection civile. Depuis six jours, a affirmé M. Saleh, « alors que la carte du contrôle militaire a changé », les attaques brutales lancées par le régime syrien, la Russie et les milices iraniennes transfrontalières contre les civils syriens se sont intensifiées, en particulier dans les zones qui échappent à leur contrôle dans le nord-ouest de la Syrie. « Qui pourrait penser qu’un État Membre de l’ONU et membre permanent du Conseil de sécurité participe à ce crime odieux et franchisse des milliers de kilomètres à bord de ses avions pour lancer des attaques meurtrières contre la population et détruire des hôpitaux et des installations vitales? » a dénoncé cet intervenant, en faisant référence à la Russie.\\n\\nLa Türkiye a pour sa part blâmé la « réticence de Damas » à s’engager dans un processus politique avec l’opposition comme la cause première de la crise actuelle. Pour cette délégation, l’erreur consistant à sous-traiter la lutte contre l’État islamique à une autre organisation terroriste, « les prétendues Forces démocratiques syriennes », doit cesser. « Cette entité séparatiste n’est ni syrienne, ni démocratique; ce n’est rien d’autre que le PKK/YPG lui-même, soit une organisation terroriste séparatiste », contre laquelle la Türkiye n’hésitera pas à prendre les mesures qui s’imposent pour se protéger, a-t-elle dit.\\n\\nPour l’Envoyé spécial, la crainte principale porte sur les conséquences que pourrait avoir sur la prestation de services à Alep le fait que des « entités désignées » administrent désormais une ville de 2 millions d’habitants. Un fait particulièrement préoccupant qui rend donc d’autant plus crucial selon lui le renouvellement, par le Conseil de sécurité, de l’exception humanitaire prévue par sa résolution 2664 (2022). Devant l’« énorme incertitude » qui pèse sur la situation actuelle sur le terrain, M. Pedersen a considéré que le chemin de la désescalade doit s’orienter vers un horizon politique crédible pour le peuple syrien, car le « patchwork d’accords de cessez-le-feu » convenus en 2019 et 2020 ne relève jamais que d’une gestion insuffisante du conflit. Statu quo intenable pour l’Algérie, qui, s’exprimant au nom des A3+, a plaidé pour que la recherche d’une solution durable aille de pair avec une coordination renforcée de la lutte contre le terrorisme.\\n\\nLes affrontements actuels nous rappellent brutalement qu’un « conflit gelé » n’est pas la paix, a argué le Royaume-Uni, et que seul un règlement politique mené et contrôlé par les Syriens eux-mêmes permettra d’y mettre fin. Pour la délégation britannique, ce sont le « régime d’Assad » et ses soutiens russes et iraniens qui ont créé les conditions de l’escalade actuelle par leur refus persistant de s’engager dans le processus politique. « Tous les acteurs du conflit doivent soutenir et participer de manière constructive aux négociations, comme l’exige la résolution 2664 (2022) », a-t-elle tranché.\\n\\nQuant à la République islamique d’Iran, elle a demandé la tenue d’une séance d’urgence des Ministres des affaires étrangères participant au processus d’Astana afin d’élaborer une stratégie unifiée pour mettre un terme aux activités terroristes dans le pays. Le Liban, qui a pris la parole au nom du Groupe des États arabes, a exprimé son soutien à la Syrie face à l’État islamique, au Front el-Nosra et aux entités et groupes qui leur sont affiliés, condamnant les actes d’agression répétés d’Israël à son encontre et l’occupation israélienne continue du Golan syrien.\\n\\n***LA SITUATION AU MOYEN-ORIENT***\\n\\n**Déclarations**\\n\\nM. GEIR PEDERSEN, Envoyé spécial du Secrétaire général pour la Syrie, a déclaré que, la semaine dernière, des changements spectaculaires s’étaient produits sur les lignes de front en Syrie, modifiant radicalement le statu quo en place depuis plus de quatre ans. Une vaste portion du territoire est passée sous le contrôle d’acteurs non étatiques, notamment l’organisation terroriste Hay’at Tahrir el-Cham ou Organisation de libération du Levant (HTS), inscrite sur la liste des sanctions du Conseil de sécurité, et des groupes d’opposition armés, dont l’Armée nationale syrienne. Ces groupes contrôlent désormais de facto un territoire comptant environ 7 millions de personnes, dont Alep –la deuxième plus grande ville de Syrie.\\n\\nAinsi, le 27 novembre, la « salle d’opérations conjointes Al-Fatah al-Mubin » –une coalition regroupant à la fois HTS et des groupes d’opposition armés– a lancé une opération terrestre, soutenue par des drones, à travers les lignes de désescalade convenues, prenant de facto le contrôle de la quasi-totalité des provinces d’Alep et d’Edleb. Les forces gouvernementales syriennes se sont depuis regroupées et ont établi des lignes défensives à Hama, repoussant certains combattants, a précisé le haut fonctionnaire. « Mais au moment où je vous parle, ces lignes sont mises à rude épreuve, HTS et les groupes d’opposition armés gagnant du terrain, avançant au plus près de Hama, une grande ville d’environ un million d’habitants. »\\n\\nLes frappes aériennes progouvernementales se sont intensifiées ces derniers jours, sur des cibles militaires et civiles, y compris des infrastructures civiles telles que des hôpitaux, causant des victimes civiles, a poursuivi l’Envoyé spécial. Et au fur et à mesure de leur progression, HTS et les groupes d’opposition armés tiraient des barrages de drones et de roquettes, provoquant des victimes civiles à Alep et également à Hama.\\n\\nEntre-temps, a poursuivi M. Pedersen, la violence a éclaté sur un deuxième axe, avec le lancement par l’Armée nationale syrienne (ANS) d’une opération le 30 novembre sur Tell Rifaat, une poche au nord d’Alep placée sous le contrôle de facto des forces affiliées aux Forces démocratiques syriennes (FDS). En réponse, les FDS déployées dans le nord-est de la Syrie se sont rapidement déplacées pour se connecter à ces poches. L’ANS a désormais largement vaincu ces forces dans ces zones, avec une évacuation à grande échelle de combattants et de dizaines de milliers de civils vers le nord-est de la Syrie, a expliqué M. Pedersen.\\n\\nCe matin, les FDS ont repris aux forces gouvernementales le contrôle de sept villages à Deïr el-Zor, invoquant une menace imminente de l’État islamique, avec apparemment le soutien militaire de la coalition internationale dirigée par les États-Unis. Les hostilités entre l’ANS et les FDS se sont intensifiées sur la ligne de front du nord-est, des informations faisant état d’une escalade des tensions près de Manbej aujourd’hui. Des frappes aériennes israéliennes ont touché la frontière syro-libanaise cette semaine, ainsi que Damas aujourd’hui.\\n\\nLe Gouvernement syrien a déclaré son intention de rétablir son contrôle sur l’ensemble des territoires syriens, avec le soutien de la Russie et de l’Iran, qui ont affirmé que ces attaques constituaient une violation des accords d’Astana et accusant également les forces extérieures. De leur côté, l’opposition syrienne et les institutions affiliées ont initialement présenté l’opération comme un moyen de dissuader ce qu’elles ont qualifié d’« escalade » de la part des forces gouvernementales syriennes contre les civils et de permettre le retour des personnes déplacées. Depuis, elles ont affirmé que l’opération se poursuivrait jusqu’à ce que le gouvernement s’engage dans un processus politique pour mettre en œuvre la résolution 2254, a noté M. Pedersen. Pour la Türkiye, qui a qualifié les événements de « réponse aux violations répétées des accords d’Astana », et qui nie toute implication, Damas doit se réconcilier à la fois avec son peuple et avec l’opposition politique légitime de la Syrie, a relevé l’Envoyé spécial.\\n\\n« Vous devez être conscient que ces développements ont provoqué des réactions différentes au sein du peuple syrien –une grave menace pour certains, un signal d’espoir pour d’autres », a déclaré le haut fonctionnaire à l’adresse des membres du Conseil. Sa crainte principale porte sur les conséquences que pourrait avoir sur la prestation de services le fait que des « entités désignées » administrent une ville de 2 millions d’habitants. Un fait particulièrement préoccupant qui rend donc d’autant plus crucial selon lui le renouvellement, par le Conseil de sécurité, de l’exception humanitaire prévue par la résolution 2664 (2022) du Conseil de sécurité.\\n\\nLa situation actuelle, marquée par des témoignages contradictoires, est sous-tendue par une énorme incertitude quant à l’avenir immédiat et par le danger d’une nouvelle effusion de sang. Après avoir plaidé en faveur d’une désescalade et d’un retour au calme, M. Pedersen a appelé toutes les parties à respecter leurs obligations en vertu du droit international pour protéger les civils et les infrastructures civiles et permettre un passage sûr aux Syriens fuyant la violence.\\n\\nMais la désescalade doit s’accompagner d’un horizon politique crédible pour le peuple syrien, a analysé l’Envoyé spécial, car le « patchwork d’accords de cessez-le-feu » convenus en 2019 et 2020 ne constitue qu’une « gestion du conflit », tant qu’il ne sera pas lié à un processus politique pour résoudre la crise. Il s’agit donc d’une situation intenable pour l’Envoyé spécial, qui a mis en garde contre le fait que de nouveaux développements dans le nord-est du pays menacent également de défaire d’autres accords de cessez-le-feu en place depuis 2019. Si nous ne voyons pas de désescalade et une évolution rapide vers un processus politique sérieux, impliquant les parties syriennes et les principaux acteurs internationaux, » alors je crains que nous assistions à une aggravation de la crise ».\\n\\nM. RAED AL SALEH, Directeur des Casques blancs, a adressé une demande claire aux membres du Conseil de sécurité: mettre fin aux crimes infligés au peuple syrien, y compris les disparitions et déplacements forcés, les bombardements et le siège des villes. Depuis six jours, alors que la carte du contrôle militaire a changé, les attaques brutales lancées par le régime syrien, la Russie et les milices iraniennes transfrontalières contre les Syriens se sont intensifiées, en particulier dans les zones qui échappent à leur contrôle dans le nord-ouest de la Syrie, a-t-il affirmé.\\n\\nLes Casques blancs ont répondu à 275 attaques qui ont tué 100 civils, en ont blessé 360, et déplacé des dizaines de milliers de résidents, dont la plupart sont des femmes et des enfants. Les attaques ont délibérément visé des civils et des infrastructures vitales, des écoles, des hôpitaux et des camps de personnes déplacées, s’est indigné M. Al Saleh. « Qui pourrait penser qu’un État Membre de l’ONU et membre permanent du Conseil de sécurité participe à ce crime odieux et franchit des milliers de kilomètres à bord de ses avions pour lancer des attaques meurtrières contre la population et détruire des hôpitaux et des installations vitales? »\\n\\nLe Directeur des Casques blancs a accusé la Russie d’avoir orchestré des attaques aériennes qui ont mis hors service quatre hôpitaux de la ville d’Edleb hier, en violation flagrante du droit international. Il a dit avoir des preuves de cette journée barbare « qu’il n’oubliera jamais », cette journée qui a été l’une des plus sanglantes de ces dernières années. Le régime syrien et la Russie ont tué 25 civils, dont la plupart étaient des enfants, et en ont blessé 66 autres ».\\n\\nAprès le changement de l’équilibre des forces sur le terrain, les habitants de la ville d’Alep et de ses environs paient à nouveau le prix de la politique de la terre brûlée du régime et de ses alliés, qui pratiquent la punition collective au lieu de chercher une solution politique. S’adressant aux habitants d’Alep, M. Al Saleh leur a dit: « Sachez que nous sommes à vos côtés. Nous partageons vos craintes d’une nouvelle escalade militaire et nous cherchons à vous soutenir et à panser vos plaies. » Il a rappelé que depuis leur création, les Casques blancs n’ont eu de cesse de soutenir le peuple syrien dans toute sa diversité. « Nous sommes issus du peuple, pour le peuple », mais, a-t-il déploré, il nous est devenu impossible de continuer à fournir nos services dans les zones qui sont passées sous le contrôle du régime. Au fil des ans, les Casques blancs ont perdu 313 volontaires, la majorité d’entre eux ayant été pris pour cible par le régime syrien et ses alliés, a-t-il relevé.\\n\\nFace à l’ampleur de cette crise, le Directeur a appelé le Conseil de sécurité à agir immédiatement et de manière décisive, à prendre des mesures concrètes pour protéger les civils et mettre fin aux attaques contre les installations vitales, les travailleurs humanitaires et les premiers intervenants. Les violations continues du droit international humanitaire, y compris la menace imminente d’attaques chimiques, doivent cesser maintenant, a-t-il martelé. Pointant que l’escalade actuelle survient à un moment où seulement 30% du plan de réponse humanitaire pour la Syrie a été atteint, soit le niveau le plus bas depuis le début de la crise humanitaire en Syrie, M. Al Saleh a salué les ONG syriennes qui, malgré les circonstances difficiles, sont à la tête de la réponse humanitaire. Un financement et une aide immédiats sont nécessaires pour les millions de civils touchés et le Conseil doit préserver l’accès transfrontalier afin que l’aide continue d’arriver à ceux qui en ont le plus besoin.\\n\\nLe peuple syrien vous a demandé de prendre des mesures immédiates pour mettre fin aux atrocités et garantir la paix, a-t-il rappelé aux membres du Conseil. Ces dernières années, la communauté internationale a laissé tomber la Syrie sur le plan politique et en termes de réponse humanitaire, a-t-il regretté, notant que les horreurs qui se déroulent aujourd’hui sont la conséquence directe de cette négligence, de l’absence d’action alors qu’elle était désespérément nécessaire. « La Syrie a été un terrain d’essai pour l’impunité, et l’incapacité à tenir les auteurs pour responsables a eu des répercussions catastrophiques bien au-delà de nos frontières, enhardissant les acteurs en Ukraine, au Soudan et à Gaza », en a conclu le Directeur des Casques blancs. « Depuis plus de 12 ans, ce Conseil a totalement laissé tomber le peuple syrien », a-t-il insisté en exprimant l’espoir que ses paroles, aujourd’hui, ne tomberont pas à nouveau dans l’oreille d’un sourd.\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*NOUVEAU - Suivez la couverture des réunions en direct sur notre** [**LIVE**](https://cms.press.un.org/fr/live)**\\\\*\\\\*\\\\***\\n\\n[Moyen-Orient](https://press.un.org/fr/moyen-orient)\\n\\n[Syrie](https://press.un.org/fr/syrie)\\n\\n**À l’intention des organes d’information.

       " ReliefArticle(title='United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen briefing to the Security Council (3 December 2024)', body='As Delivered\\n\\nThank you Mr President,\\n\\n1\\\\. In the last week, we have seen dramatic shifts in frontlines in Syria, radically altering a status quo that had been largely in place well over four years. The situation is extremely fluid and dangerous. But as I brief you today, a vast swathe of territory has come under the control of non-state actors, including Security Council-listed terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and armed opposition groups, including the Syrian National Army. These groups now de facto control territory containing what we estimate to be some 7 million people, including Aleppo – Syria’s second biggest city and a vast and diverse metropolis of more than 2 million people.\\n\\n2\\\\. On 27 November, the al-Fateh al-Mubeen Joint Operations Room—a coalition containing both HTS and armed opposition groups – launched a ground operation, with drone cover, across agreed de-escalation lines, taking de facto control of almost the entirety of Aleppo and Idlib governorates.\\n\\n3\\\\. Syrian Government forces have since regrouped and established defensive lines in Hama, repelling some fighters. But as I speak to you this afternoon, these are being severely tested, with HTS and armed opposition groups gaining ground today, advancing very close to Hama – a major city of some 1 million people.\\n\\n4\\\\. Pro-Government airstrikes have intensified in recent days, with reports of strikes on both military and civilian targets, including civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, causing civilian casualties.\\n\\n5\\\\. As HTS and armed opposition groups have advanced, they have fired barrages of drones and rockets, with reports of civilian casualties as a result, in Aleppo and also in Hama.\\n\\n6\\\\. Meanwhile, we have seen violence erupt on a second axis, with the opposition Syrian National Army launching an operation on 30 November on Tal Rifaat, a pocket north of Aleppo city under the de facto control of SDF-affiliated forces. In response, SDF forces in northeast Syria moved rapidly to connect with these pockets. The SNA has now largely defeated these forces in these areas, with a large-scale evacuation of fighters and tens of thousands of civilians to northeast Syria.\\n\\n7\\\\. In addition, the potential for conflict on other axes remains alive. This morning the SDF took seven villages previously under the control of Government forces in Deir-ez-Zor, citing an imminent ISIL threat, reportedly with military support from the US-led International Coalition. There has been increased front-line hostilities between the SNA and SDF in areas of the northeast, with reports of escalating tensions as we speak near Menbij now. Israeli airstrikes hit the Syrian-Lebanese border this week, as well as Damascus today.\\n\\nMr President,\\n\\n8\\\\. The Syrian Government has said the terrorist attacks pose grave dangers to Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, to regional security, and to the international community. It has stated its intention to combat terrorism and restore all Syrian territories to its control. Russia and Iran have expressed their support, saying the attacks are a violation of Astana agreements, and also blaming external forces.\\n\\n9\\\\. The Syrian Opposition and affiliated institutions initially framed the operation as deterring what they said were escalating attacks by Syrian Government forces on civilians, and enabling the return of the displaced. Statements since have said the operation will continue until the Government engages in a political process to implement resolution 2254 and announced the intention to seize territory from the Syrian Government and the SDF.\\n\\n10\\\\. Türkiye has characterized events as a response to repeated violations of the Astana agreements, stating it is not involved in current clashes. Türkiye has said these events show that Damascus must reconcile with both its people and the legitimate political opposition of Syria.\\n\\n11\\\\. The United States, which has forces on the ground in eastern Syria, has said it has nothing to do with the offensive, calling for de-escalation and a credible UN-led political process.\\n\\nMr President,\\n\\n12\\\\. Let me stress the situation is in flux and it is very early days, with an unclear information environment. But you need to be aware, that these developments have provoked different reactions among the Syrian people – a grave threat for some, a signal of hope for others.\\n\\n13\\\\. We have seen a series of public pronouncements by different armed actors in the northwest, including Security-Council designated HTS, offering reassurances to all civilians, including minorities, and including assurances of religious freedom. In the last three days, we have seen some media reports of civilians in Aleppo continuing their normal lives, for instance with churches holding services this weekend.\\n\\n14\\\\. But Mr President, some civilian and minority voices have expressed to us despair and fear about what it would mean over time for these areas to come under the control of armed factions that include a Security Council-listed terrorist group. Some women leaders have expressed particular fears or concerns and are seeking reassurances.\\n\\n15\\\\. There are reports of services resuming in Aleppo. But there are also fears about what it will mean for service delivery, if designated entities oversee de facto administrative arrangements in a city of 2 million people. This is particularly concerning and therefore it will be important that this Council renew the relevant provisions of the humanitarian carveout in Security Council resolution 2664. I hope all of those with influence can address these issues.\\n\\n16\\\\. There are videos and testimonies of detainees - men and women - being released from detention centers, including some who say they were detained for over a decade. But equally there have been videos of large-scale detention of prisoners of war by HTS and armed opposition groups.\\n\\n17\\\\. There are signs of many displaced persons, from inside and outside of Syria, returning to their homes for the first time in years, or even a decade. But equally tens of thousands have already been displaced – some by airstrikes, some by increased hostilities and some by shifts in control. In Sheikh Maqsoud and other neighborhoods in Aleppo city, there are tens of thousands of civilians under the control of some remaining YPG or SDF units, expressing fears that they too may soon be forced to leave their homes.\\n\\n18\\\\. Underlying all of this is an enormous uncertainty about the immediate future, and the danger that more bloodshed could be on its way.\\n\\nMr President,\\n\\n19\\\\. My first core-message is simple: we need de-escalation and we need calm. I appeal to all parties to their obligations under international law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and allow safe passage for Syrians fleeing violence. But Mr President this alone does not suffice. Further military escalation risks mass displacement and civilian casualties. The last fourteen years of conflict have decisively shown that no Syrian party or existing grouping of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means. We must de-escalate and ensure a cooperative approach to countering listed terrorist groups.\\n\\n20\\\\. But – and this is my second core message – de-escalation needs to be accompanied by a credible political horizon for the Syrian people. For almost half a decade we saw frontlines frozen, and violence often elevated but somewhat contained, due to a patchwork of ceasefire arrangements agreed between international actors in 2019 and 2020. This was positive. But without being pegged to a political process to resolve the crisis, this amounted only to a conflict-management approach. And this is not enough.\\n\\n21\\\\. I have long been warning that this was unsustainable – especially after rising violence within Syria the last three years, alongside regional spillover and expanding Israeli strikes. Now, in the space of a week, we have seen the de-escalation lines agreed in 2020 and earlier, entirely unravel.\\n\\nMr President,\\n\\n22\\\\. The Syrian parties and key international stakeholders need to be seriously engaged in meaningful and substantive negotiations to find a way out of the conflict. That is why today I call for urgent and serious political engagement – among Syrian and international stakeholders - to spare bloodshed and focus on a political solution, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254.\\n\\n23\\\\. To this end, I have been working the phone with the full range of Syrian parties and key international stakeholders, urging concrete and immediate action on these two fronts including with the Syrian Government, the Syrian opposition, Türkiye, Russia, Iran, the United States and Arab and European players. I will be in the region in the coming days for a range of high-level meetings.\\n\\n24\\\\. I have clearly signaled – and signal here once again – my readiness to use my good offices to convene international and Syria stakeholders in new and comprehensive peace talks on Syria.\\n\\n25\\\\. I have been sharing and discussing ideas in this regard for several months, precisely because I anticipated that the unsustainable status quo would collapse and a common consensus on a comprehensive approach would be needed – an approach that goes beyond only the resumption of Constitutional Committee meetings, but which addresses the full range of aspirations and concerns: the political process, sovereignty, security, economic conditions and sanctions, the detained and missing, and refugees, and the displaced. These ideas are more, not less relevant, following the events of this week. I urge all parties to engage not only on containing the crisis, but on resolving this conflict. That is what is needed now.\\n\\n26\\\\. There is no military solution to this conflict. If we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis. Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction. The consequences for the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, and for the wellbeing and aspirations of the Syrian people, could be grave indeed. Mr President, this should be in no-one’s interest.\\n\\nThank you, Mr President.', original_date='2024-12-03T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='‘Dramatic Shifts in Front Lines’ Radically Changing Situation as Non-State Actors Take Control of Syrian Territory, Senior Official Warns Security Council', body=\"**9798th Meeting (PM)**\\n\\n**SC/15919**\\n\\n**Delegations Accuse Each Other of Being Responsible for Recent Hostilities**\\n\\nA vast swathe of Syrian territory — containing approximately 7 million people — has come under the control of non-State actors, including the terrorist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and armed opposition groups, the Organization’s senior official for that country told the Security Council today, as he warned that more bloodshed could be on its way.\\n\\n“In the last week, we have seen dramatic shifts in front lines in Syria, radically altering a status quo,” [said ](https://reliefweb.int/node/4115347)Geir Pederson, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, addressing the Council via video conference. On 27 November, the al-Fateh al-Mubeen Joint Operations Room — a coalition containing both Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and armed opposition groups, including the Syrian National Army — launched a ground operation, with drone cover, across agreed de-escalation lines, taking de facto control of almost the entirety of Aleppo and Idlib governorates.\\n\\nHe underscored that even though Syrian Government forces have since regrouped and established defensive lines in Hama, repelling some fighters, they are being “severely tested”, with Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and armed opposition groups advancing very close to Hama — a major city of some 1 million people. In addition, pro-Government air strikes on both military and civilian targets — including hospitals — have intensified in recent days. Meanwhile, violence has erupted on a second axis, with the opposition Syrian National Army launching an operation on 30 November on Tal Rifaat, a pocket north of Aleppo city under the de facto control of Syrian Democratic Forces-affiliated (SDF) forces.\\n\\nStressing that “the situation is in flux”, with an unclear information environment, he said that these developments have provoked different reactions among the Syrian people — “a grave threat for some, a signal of hope for others”. Armed actors in the north-west — including Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham – have offered reassurances to all civilians, including minorities, through a series of public pronouncements. Nevertheless, some women leaders have expressed particular fears and are seeking reassurances.\\n\\n“We need de-escalation and we need calm,” he said, appealing to all parties to protect civilian populations and infrastructure and allow safe passage for Syrians fleeing violence. However, “this alone does not suffice,” he stressed, adding that the Syrian conflict cannot be resolved via military means and de-escalation must be accompanied by a credible political horizon for the Syrian people.\\n\\nAlso briefing the Council was Raed Al Saleh, Director of the White Helmets, who said his organization has been responding to the brutal attacks on Syrians launched by the country’s regime, the Russian Federation and Iranian cross-border militias, which have escalated in the last six days. Yesterday, Moscow launched air strikes that put four hospitals in Idlib out of service, he said, asking: “Who would expect a Member State of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council to participate in this heinous crime and cross thousands of kilometres in its aircraft to launch deadly attacks on the population and destroy hospitals and vital facilities?” The strikes killed 25 civilians, most of them children, who were impatiently waiting to say goodbye to their tents in a camp near Idlib and return to their village, he said.\\n\\nTurning to Aleppo, which also “had its share of Syrian-Russian death and destruction”, he said over the past few days, the White Helmets responded to air strikes that targeted the university hospital, a church, and residential areas in the city. The White Helmets have dispatched ambulances and specialized teams to work alongside the city's humanitarian partners and emergency services. Highlighting the real threat of chemical attacks, he called on the Russian Federation to end its use of the veto that supports that regime.\\n\\nIn the ensuing discussions, many delegates, voicing deep concern over the recent intensification of hostilities in Syria, urged all parties to de-escalate and prioritize dialogue. Several speakers accused their counterparts of being responsible in the uptick of violence and the ongoing conflict.\\n\\n“Syria remains as dangerous as ever,” warned the United Kingdom’s delegate, expressing deep concern that further escalation — particularly Moscow’s large-scale attacks against civilians — will only lead to more displacement of vulnerable people, disrupted humanitarian aid access and more suffering. Through its ongoing refusal to engage in the political process, “the Assad regime — along with its Russian and Iranian backers — has created the conditions for instability”, he asserted, calling for de-escalation.\\n\\nA significant shift in Syria “has again turned into an active war zone”, observed Slovenia’s representative. The actions of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham have already taken human lives and have profound implications for international peace and security. Reignition of a wider conflict in Syria could also have a devastating impact on the region, he cautioned, declaring: “We cannot allow the recent resurgence of violence to add another fuel to the fire that will further extend the conflict.”\\n\\nAlgeria’s delegate, also speaking for Guyana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone, said the recent attacks, including those perpetrated by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, have led to the tragic loss of innocent civilian lives. He said there is no longer time for conflict management, calling on the international community to prioritize a durable political solution that preserves Syria's unity and territorial integrity.\\n\\nThe recent hostilities occurred amid a deteriorated humanitarian situation, said France’s representative, underlining that “everything must be done to avoid disruption of humanitarian access as well as further population displacement”. As winter approaches, access to humanitarian assistance must be maintained to keep these paths open, both across borders and across front lines, he added.\\n\\n“Terrorism is the common enemy of the international community,” China’s delegate said, expressing concern about the seizure of the Iranian consulate in Aleppo. Stressing the importance of assisting the Syrian Government in eliminating the threat by terrorist forces in its territory, he said the international community must take measures to cut off their channels for obtaining weapons. Foreign forces must end their illegal military presence in Syria and the relevant country should immediately lift its unilateral sanctions, he said, emphasizing that a political settlement, respectful of Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, is the only way out.\\n\\nHowever, the representative of the United States, Council President for December, spoke in his national capacity, emphasizing that the “Assad regime’s refusal to engage in the political process outlined in resolution 2254 (2015) — and its reliance on Moscow and Tehran — created the conditions now unfolding”. The recent rebel offensive — “which the U.S. had nothing to do with”, he declared — is being led by a group designated as a terrorist organization by both the United States and the United Nations. However, such designation does not justify further atrocities by “the Assad regime and its Russian backers”, he stressed. He added: “The Council must speak with one voice in demanding that all parties cease brutal aerial attacks and adhere to international law.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, expressing regret that the Special Envoy did not have the courage to “call a spade a spade”, condemned the terrorist attack on Syria by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and other illegal armed groups. Western nations chose to ignore his delegation’s repeated warnings against engaging with international terrorists, he said, adding that the waiting militants took advantage of the difficult situation in the Golan Heights and the border with Lebanon “to stab the Syrian people in the back”. The Syrian armed forces, supported by Russian aerospace forces and other allies, have been making targeted strikes against the terrorists, he noted.\\n\\nAccording to available information, the terrorists are primarily supported by the Americans and their allies, he added, drawing attention to the involvement of Ukraine's intelligence directorate in training and supplying weapons to the militants. Washington, D.C., and its allies are exploiting every opportunity to sow chaos in Syria while “whitewashing” Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham as a moderate Syrian opposition, he added.\\n\\nFor his part, Syria’s representative said that Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham aims to seize control of multiple areas in northern Syria, especially in the governorates of Aleppo and Idlib, and the international highway which connects the northern and southern regions of the country. Noting the continued influx of terrorists and weapons across the northern borders, he underlined that the scale and scope of the terrorist attack unequivocally demonstrates the extent of international support they are receiving.\\n\\nMore so, he pointed out that this terrorist attack — which disrupted all aspects of life in Aleppo — could not have been carried out without a joint Turkish-Israeli green light and operational border. His country will take all necessary measures to defend its citizens, he said, adding that the terrorist organizations who have stained their hands with the blood of Syrians are part of the problem and not part of the solution.\\n\\nSeveral delegations, under rule 37, also took the floor, including Türkiye’s representative who, citing the Syrian conflict as “a stark reminder of the costs of political inaction”, emphasized that without a genuine process of national reconciliation, the country will remain trapped in a cycle of instability and suffering. However, Israel’s ongoing attacks across the region further complicate the fragile situation. As well, the violations of the Astana agreements — initiated by Ankara to achieve de-escalation on the ground — “have pushed Syria further into chaos”, he said.\\n\\nLebanon’s delegate, speaking for the Arab Group, also said it is essential to stay away from foreign agendas and called for the withdrawal of all external forces from Syria. He condemned the attack led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and —noting the dire repercussions to regional and international peace — voiced support for Damascus as it combats terrorism in the form of Da’esh, the Nusra Front and affiliated groups as well as the repeated Israeli aggression and occupation of the Syrian Golan.\\n\\nIn the same vein, Iran’s representative stressed that, “at the heart of this crisis, lies external support and intervention”. He said that the scale and sophistication of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s operations “highlight deliberate external support, with the United States at the forefront”. Stressing that “what happened in Aleppo and Idlib should serve as a wake-up call for the entire region regarding the resurgence of terrorism and extremism”, he stated that no distinction can — or should — be made between types of terrorism. “If the international community fails to confront this terrorist group decisively, its growing dominance over parts of Syria could trigger catastrophic consequences,” he said.\\n\\nAt the outset of today’s meeting, despite a point of order by the Russian Federation, the Council decided to extend an invitation — under rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure — to Raed Al Saleh, Director of the White Helmets, to participate in it, by a recorded vote of 11 votes in favour to 2 against (Russian Federation, China), with 2 abstentions (Algeria, Mozambique).\\n\\n**For information media.

This intensifying crisis risks aggravating an already dire situation in NES, where vulnerable populations face immense challenges accessing essential services and securing basic needs. The ongoing conflict in Northwest Syria has displaced thousands of families, with potential spillover effects threatening to overwhelm NES's already overstretched resources. Overcrowded camps lack the capacity to absorb additional arrivals. Shelters are inadequate and in poor condition increasing health and protection risks for those already displaced and new arrivals from Northwest.  \\n\\nJust over a month ago, a significant escalation of airstrikes in NES caused catastrophic damage to critical infrastructure, including electricity and water systems, leaving more than 1.05 million people without power and disrupting access to clean water for thousands. These strikes compounded the long-term damage caused by recurrent hostilities over the past year, further restricting civilians’ access to essential services and increasing their vulnerability.

This is tragic, as many have lived in misery since the outbreak of conflict nearly 14 years ago.\\n\\nOur Office has documented a number of extremely concerning incidents resulting in multiple civilian casualties, including a high number of women and children, stemming from attacks by both Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and by pro-government forces. The hostilities are resulting in destruction and damage to civilian objects, including health facilities, buildings hosting institutions dedicated to education, and food markets.\\n\\nWe are in the process of verifying deadly attacks impacting civilians. For example:\\n\\nOn 29 November, four civilian men were killed reportedly as a result of multiple ground-based strikes by HTS hitting an area hosting the Aleppo university student dormitories in the Hamdaniyah neighborhood in the western part of the city of Aleppo. According to information gathered by our Office, all victims were students of the university and, following that, many other students fled the university complex.\\n\\nOn 1 December, 22 civilians were killed, including three women and seven children, and at least 40 others were injured reportedly as a result of multiple airstrikes by pro-government forces in Idlib. According to information received, multiple airstrikes hit a local market and five residential areas in the city. Most of the victims were in the streets near their homes and in the market at the time of the airstrikes. The air attacks also caused significant damage to civilian houses, shops, the local market, the Al-Hayat Mosque and the Al-Fatih Elementary School.\\n\\nWe remind all parties of their obligations and responsibilities under international human rights law and humanitarian law: civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.\\n\\nEven before half a million people fled across the border from the fighting in Lebanon in September, an estimated 16.7 million Syrians were in need of humanitarian assistance. It is tragic that so many have had to put up with such hardship for so long.\\n\\nTens of thousands more people have been displaced since 27 November, and their situation is now critical as winter draws in. Life-saving assistance is largely unable to reach the conflict zone. Hospitals and public health facilities in Aleppo are running at maximum capacity and have limited staffing and supplies.\\n\\nThe High Commissioner urges all parties to de-escalate, protect civilians and allow vital aid to flow through to those in need. Furthermore, we call on third parties with influence to do everything in their power to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, promote dialogue and to prevent this ongoing violence from exacerbating the suffering of the Syrian people and from further inflaming regional tensions.\\n\\n## **For more information and media requests, please contact:**\\n\\nRavina Shamdasani: + 41 22 917 9169 / **ravina.shamdasani@un.org**  \\n Jeremy Laurence: +41 22 917 9383 / **jeremy.laurence@un.org**  \\n Thameen Al-Kheetan: +41 22 917 4232 / **thameen.alkheetan@un.org**\\n\\n## **Tag and share**\\n\\n**Twitter** [**@UNHumanRights**](https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights)  \\n**Facebook** [**unitednationshumanrights**](https://www.facebook.com/unitednationshumanrights)  \\n**Instagram** [**@unitednationshumanrights**](https://www.instagram.com/unitednationshumanrights/)', original_date='2024-12-03T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

The Human Rights Council also tasked the Commission with establishing the facts and circumstances that may amount to such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to identify those responsible with a view of ensuring that perpetrators of violations, including those that may constitute crimes against humanity, are held accountable.

We urgently call all parties to the conflict to protect civilians, particularly women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities, who find themselves trapped in this violence.\\n\\nThe situation is dire; recent reports confirm at least 125 attacks, including shelling and airstrikes, occurred in Idleb and western Aleppo over just three days (November 26-28). Tragically, these hostilities resulted in the deaths of at least twenty-two civilians, including two humanitarian volunteers, five children and several women, and left seventy-eight others injured, including twelve children, during this period. The international community must act decisively to protect these vulnerable populations and uphold the sanctity of civilian life.\\n\\nAs of November 30, over 48,500 people - nearly half of whom are children- have been displaced, according to UN reports. The situation remains volatile, and figures are still being verified amidst ongoing violence. The challenges facing these newly displaced families are compounded by harsh winter conditions, placing them at extreme risk. This crisis comes amid an already strained humanitarian response in Northwest Syria, intensified by the recent influx of displacements from Lebanon and a critical funding shortfall. Without immediate intervention and adequate resources, the capacity to meet the escalating needs of these vulnerable populations is gravely undermined.\\n\\nSince November 27th , 30 humanitarian NGOs in Idleb have reported suspensions of humanitarian activities due to ongoing fighting and access constraints. At least 24 health facilities have halted services, along with protection services, community centers, and gender-based violence (GBV) support. Public and private schools, as well as universities in Idleb and western Aleppo, have suspended classes, disrupting education for countless students.\\n\\nNorthwest Syria has faced intensified attacks since September 23, alternating between brief periods of calm and escalated violence. This increase in hostilities coincides with a critical funding gap for the crossborder response, which is facing its worst shortfall since the onset of the crisis. With only a month remaining in the year, the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan for Syria has secured less than 30% of the $4.07 billion needed to support the most vulnerable populations. Underfunding has forced the suspension of essential aid and services, including WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene), and health support in over eighty facilities.\\n\\nThe Syrian conflict has now been ongoing for 14 years, characterized by a profound lack of political resolution and the alarming normalization of violations of International Humanitarian Law. Indiscriminate attacks on civilians- especially children- have surged, with schools targeted in the escalating violence. Rather than seeing an end to this protracted crisis, hostilities have intensified, leaving civilians, particularly children, to suffer the most.\\n\\nAmidst the unspeakable human suffering, the Northwest Syria NGO Forum members are ungently calling for immediate and decisive action to address this escalating crisis:\\n\\n**To parties of the conflict:**\\n\\n1\\\\) Immediate cessation of hostilities and adherence to the International Humanitarian Law by all parties, ensuring the protection of all civilians and civilian infrastructure.\\n\\n2\\\\) Guarantee unhindered humanitarian access and protection of humanitarian workers to enable safe and unrestricted delivery of lifesaving aid to all affected populations.\\n\\n**To the UN and member states:**\\n\\n1\\\\) Intensify diplomatic and legal efforts to implement de-escalation mechanisms and de-confliction of civilian and humanitarian locations to ensure protection of civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian workers.\\n\\n2\\\\) Call for unconditional cross-border humanitarian accessto the affected populations in Northwest Syria, including the reportedly newly NSAGs (Non-State Armed Groups)-controlled areas.\\n\\n**To donors and humanitarian actors:**\\n\\n1\\\\) Urgently deploy adequate and flexible emergency funding to sustain essential and lifesaving services including winterization items, healthcare, food, protection, and shelter.\\n\\n2\\\\) Enhance coordination efforts and reinforce the Northwest Syria hub to enable efficient and effective humanitarian response in the area and implement robust monitoring and support mechanisms to maximize the impact of humanitarian aid.\\n\\n3\\\\) Streamline flexibility in the design and implementation of programmes to ensure aid can reach those in need while adapting to shifting control dynamics and emerging access opportunities.\\n\\n4\\\\) Increase funding and support for local organizations, including women-led organizations, to enhance community resilience and foster sustainability and stability in the region.', original_date='2024-12-03T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

Por ejemplo:\\n\\nEl 29 de noviembre, cuatro civiles hombres resultaron muertos supuestamente como resultado de ataques múltiples terrestres por parte de HTS, los cuales afectaron a una zona que alberga las residencias de estudiantes de la Universidad de Aleppo, situadas en el barrio de Hamdaniyah, en la zona occidental de la ciudad de Aleppo. Conforme con información recopilada por nuestra Oficina, todas las víctimas de dichos ataques eran estudiantes de la universidad y, como consecuencia de los mismos, muchos otros estudiantes decidieron abandonar el complejo universitario.\\n\\nEl 1 de diciembre, 22 civiles fueron asesinados, incluyendo tres mujeres y siete niños, además de al menos otros 40 heridos grave supuestamente como resultado de numerosos ataques aéreos por parte de fuerzas gubernamentales en Idlib. Según información recibida, un gran número de ataques aéreos afectaron un mercado local y cinco zonas residenciales de la ciudad. La mayoría de las víctimas se encontraban en las calles próximas a sus viviendas, así como en el mercado, en el momento cuando ocurrieron los ataques aéreos. Los ataques aéreos también causaron daños considerables a viviendas civiles, tiendas, al mercado local, a la Mezquita Al-Hayat, además de a la Escuela de Primaria Al-Fatih.\\n\\nRecordamos a todas las partes sus obligaciones y responsabilidades en virtud del derecho internacional humanitario y de la normativa internacional de derechos humanos: es obligatorio proteger a la población civil y la infraestructura civil.\\n\\nIncluso antes de que medio millón de personas huyeran de los combates atravesando la frontera hacia el Líbano en septiembre pasado, se calcula que 16,7 millones de personas sirias ya necesitaban de ayuda humanitaria. Es un hecho trágico que tantas personas hayan tenido que soportar tantas privaciones durante tanto tiempo.\\n\\nOtras decenas de miles de personas más se han visto asimismo obligadas a desplazarse desde el 27 de noviembre, y su situación es ahora crítica a la vez que se acerca el invierno. La ayuda vital no puede acceder en su mayor parte a la zona de conflicto. Los hospitales y los centros sanitarios públicos en Aleppo están funcionando a su máximo rendimiento y cuentan con un número limitado de personal y suministros.\\n\\nEl Alto Comisionado insta a todas las partes a reducir las tensiones, a proteger a los civiles y a permitir que la ayuda vital llegue a las personas que la necesitan. Además, hacemos un llamamiento a terceras partes con influencia en el conflicto a hacer todo lo que esté en sus manos para garantizar el cumplimiento con el derecho internacional humanitario, a fomentar el diálogo y a impedir que la violencia actual empeore el sufrimiento del pueblo sirio y avive las tensiones regionales aún más.\\n\\n## **Para más información y solicitudes de medios de comunicación, póngase en contacto con:**\\n\\nRavina Shamdasani: + 41 22 917 9169 / **ravina.shamdasani@un.org**  \\nJeremy Laurence: +41 22 917 9383 / **jeremy.laurence@un.org**  \\nThameen Al-Kheetan: +41 22 917 4232 / **thameen.alkheetan@un.org**\\n\\n## **Etiquetar y compartir**\\n\\n**Twitter** [**@UNHumanRights**](https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights)  \\n**Facebook** [**unitednationshumanrights**](https://www.facebook.com/unitednationshumanrights)  \\n**Instagram** [**@unitednationshumanrights**](https://www.instagram.com/unitednationshumanrights/)', original_date='2024-12-03T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",

We also face additional challenges in assigning responsibility for ground-based attacks, especially those in which the bombardment originates from an area adjacent to the one targeted, which is controlled by a different party to the perpetrator. In such cases, SNHR tries to thoroughly investigate each incident, in order to conclusively identify the party responsible for the bombardment. In the event this proved to be impossible, these incidents are categorized as having been perpetrated by other parties until such time as we have gathered sufficient evidence to conclusively assign responsibility.\\n\\nWhile we at the SNHR are keen to accurately ascribe responsibility for incidents to the relevant parties, we exclude two types of attacks from the process of assigning responsibility, namely anti-personnel landmines, and remote explosions, including suicide or forced suicide attacks. We discussed this issue previously in detailed reports.\\n\\nAs for anonymous victims who have not yet been identified or regarding whom we have so far been unable to find any identifying information, these cases are catalogued in a separate archive until any information confirming these victims’ identity is received.\\n\\nThis report draws upon the SNHR team’s constant daily monitoring of news and developments in Syria, and on information supplied by our extensive and varied countrywide network, which has been built up over the course of our work since 2011. SNHR also provides a special form that can be completed by victims’ relatives with victims’ names and personal information so that our Victims Documentation Department can follow up on the information provided, verify its accuracy, and then add it to the database.\\n\\nAll the attacks included in this report targeted civilian areas where we documented no military presence or armories before or during the attacks. Also, the perpetrators of these attacks failed to issue any warnings to civilians prior to any of the attacks as required by international humanitarian law.\\n\\nThe information included in this report only represents the bare minimum of the actual severity and magnitude of the violations documented. Also, it doesn’t include any analysis of the profound social, economic, and psychological ramifications of these events on those affected.', original_date='2024-12-01T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='Statement Attributable to the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Mr. Geir O. Pedersen (1 Dec 2024) [EN/AR]', body='I am closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Syria. Recent days have seen a dramatic shift in frontlines, including significant advances by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group that remains a designated terrorist group by the Security Council, and a wide range of armed opposition factions. We have also seen pro-Government airstrikes.\\n\\nIn a country torn by nearly 14 years of war and conflict, the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace and security.\\n\\nAs an immediate priority, I strongly emphasize the urgent need for all to uphold their obligations under international law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. This is a clear message to all parties engaged in hostilities of any kind. I will continue to push for civilian protection and de-escalation.\\n\\nI have repeatedly warned of the risks of escalation in Syria, of the dangers of mere conflict management rather than conflict resolution, and the reality that no Syrian party or existing grouping of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means.\\n\\nWhat we see in Syria today is a mark of a collective failure to bring about what has plainly been required now for many years – a genuine political process to implement Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).\\n\\nThe Syrian parties and key international stakeholders need to be seriously engaged in meaningful and substantive negotiations to find a way out of the conflict. Without this, Syria is in danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction.\\n\\nAccordingly, I call for urgent and serious political engagement – among Syrian and international stakeholders - to spare bloodshed and focus on a political solution in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). I will continue to engage all parties and stand ready to use my good offices to convene international and Syria stakeholders in new and comprehensive peace talks on Syria.', original_date='2024-12-01T00:00:00+00:00'),\n",
       " ReliefArticle(title='A Statement by the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, On the recent escalation of hostilities in Aleppo [EN/AR]', body=\"Damascus, 1 December 2024, I am gravely alarmed and concerned over the recent escalation of hostilities in Aleppo which started on 27 November. These attacks have resulted in the tragic loss of innocent civilian lives, including women and children, damage to civilian infrastructure and the suspension of critical services.\\n\\nThis recent escalation of hostilities is coming at a time when countless people, many of whom have already endured the trauma of displacement, are now forced to flee once more, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods. We urge all parties to the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and prioritize the protection of civilians including the safety of aid workers.\\n\\nThe people of Syria must not endure more suffering, and we urge dialogue to be given an opportunity.\\n\\nThe Syrian crisis continues to be one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises. Prior to the influx of more than half a million returnees and refugees from Lebanon since September, there were more than 16.7 million persons in need of humanitarian assistance. This latest violence adds even more lives that now need to be urgently saved.\\n\\nThe humanitarian community remains steadfast in its commitment to delivering lifesaving assistance to the affected communities. The Humanitarian Country Team in Syria is resolute in its determination to stay and to deliver vital humanitarian aid to alleviate the suffering of the affected Syrian people.\\n\\nWe call for strict adherence to International Humanitarian and Human Rights laws.\\n\\n**For more information:**\\n\\nJoseph Ingangi – Head of Office | OCHA Syria - Damascus E-mail: inganji@un.org Sevim Turkmani - Public Information Officer | OCHA Syria - Damascus E-mail: sevim.turkmani@un.org\", original_date='2024-12-01T00:00:00+00:00')]"
